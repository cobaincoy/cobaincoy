The challenges of innovation
Every business wants to be innovative. But how do you go about being innovative when you're small and new? The challenges of innovation are just as extensive as the opportunities. Here are a few tips to help you navigate them:
1. Keep your ideas open. When you come up with a new idea, keep in mind that there's always room for improvement. You might not have initially thought of it this way, but if your idea is good enough, someone else might eventually come up with a better solution or an even better way to do things. Be open to suggestions and feedback from others before you give your idea any serious consideration.

2. Don't be afraid to take risks. When it comes time to come up with a new idea, don't be afraid to take on whatever challenge seems daunting or even impossible at first.

2) Better coordination of services through better integration
One way to improve coordination of services is through better integration. This can be done by creating a single system that helps manage all the services offered, or by combining different systems into a single platform. Another idea is to create a clearinghouse for information on health and social services. This would allow users to find the right service and compare prices quickly.
