History of Invention: How did inventions come about?
Invention comes about when a person or group of people come up with a new idea for something and then try to make it a reality. Some inventions, like the printing press and the Internet, were actually born out of necessity- like during World War II when people needed to create documents quickly. Other inventions, like the telephone and the electric chair, were made because someone was just curious or had an amazing idea and didn't want to give up that idea. There are so many different types of inventions, it's hard to choose just one as the history of invention is pretty amazing!
