Innovation is a core element of the American way of life and economy. Innovation has been a driving force in technological progress, economic growth, and social progress for centuries. However, there have been periods when innovation has not been as fruitful as others. One such period was the late 19th century when many innovative technologies were not adopted or developed as quickly as desired.
