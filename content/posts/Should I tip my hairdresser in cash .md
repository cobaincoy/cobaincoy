## Should I Tip My Hairdresser In Cash? [Solved]
 There's no wrong way to give a tip. You can leave cash, write a personal check, utilize apps like Venmo and PayPal, give the tip in person or in an envelope (or a handwritten card), or simply leave it at the front desk for the hairdresser to pick up. You can make tipping as fun and personal as you'd like.1 Dec 2021
