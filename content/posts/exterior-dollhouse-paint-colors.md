Why are big ideas so powerful?
One of the key reasons why big ideas are so powerful is because they can be turned into positive actions. People who have big ideas often see the world in a new and different way than those who don’t. They are “big thinkers,” which means that they have a lot of great ideas that can make a difference in people’s lives. This power comes from the fact that big ideas are something people can believe in and pursue.
