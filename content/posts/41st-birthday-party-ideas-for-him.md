Definition of Innovation: What is new or different about a product or service?
According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, innovation is “the process of making something new and different, typically by applying creative thinking and resourcefulness.” Innovation can be found in products, services, and even ideas. However, what makes innovation unique is how it is used to meet the needs of customers or businesses. There are a number of ways to define innovation, but some examples include: 
1. Innovation can refer to any change that makes a product or service better or more efficient.
2. Innovation can refer to any approach that is different from the norm in order to improve customer satisfaction or business success.
3. Innovation can refer to anything that allows businesses to make changes in their products and services in order to improve them for their customers or themselves.

Trends in technology: How is technology changing?
Technology is constantly evolving, and with it, the way we live and work. In 2020, there are many ideas for how technology will change in the next year. Here are a few examples: 
- digitize everything: physical things will be digitized to the point where they can be stored and accessed from any device. This could include everything from your phone to your books. 
- AI will take over jobs: machines are starting to become smarter than people and can now do most tasks on their own. This could lead to layoffs in the workforce as companies adopt AI strategies to save money. 
- Virtual Reality will take over: our reality will be turned into a virtual one, allowing us to experience different worlds without ever leaving our home. This could have a number of implications, such as making travel more comfortable or increasing creativity.
