Hola, iam John Hippler, Buongiorno.
## What Are Joe Montana Cards Worth? [Solved]
Joe Montana's official rookie card is his 1981 Topps #216 card. A perfect gem-mint copy of the card (PSA or SGC 10) is worth on average between $40,000 to $50,000. Lower graded copies can found for much less; in fact a Near-Mint (PSA or SGC 7) copy of Montana's rookie card can normally be found for around $200-$300.
