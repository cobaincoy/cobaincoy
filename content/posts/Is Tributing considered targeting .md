## Is Tributing Considered Targeting? [Solved]
If you choose a monster to be tributed via an effect/summoning condition like Kaijus, is that the same as targeting them? Nope. Tributing for cost (as you did) isn't even counted as a card effect, so even if the Monarch were completely unaffected by card effects, you could still tribute it to summon a Kaiju.19 May 2016
