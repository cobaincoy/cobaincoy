## Should Asparagus Be Crunchy Or Soft When Cooked? [Solved]
 Asparagus is cooked when it is tender-crispy or crunchy and not mushy and limp. It should turn from a vibrant green to a dull olive green. However, if it's not well cooked, the spear will be too hard for a fork to pierce, while overcooked asparagus tends to fall apart when you poke it.28 Sept 2022
