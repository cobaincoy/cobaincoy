The Structure of the article: What are your thoughts on the structure of an article? Are you thinking about writing a top 5 or 10 list, or doing a more traditional approach with each section)?
There are a lot of different ways to write an article, and the structure of an article is definitely one of them. The structure of an article can be broken down into four main categories: introduction, body, conclusion, and discussion. 
1) Introduction: This is where you introduce your readers to your topic and give them a brief overview. 
2) Body: This is where you start your story and tell your readers everything they need to know to enjoy the rest of the article.
3) Conclusion: This is where you wrap up your story and let readers know what you think about it. 
4) Discussion: This is where you have reader-led conversations in order to get feedback from them.
