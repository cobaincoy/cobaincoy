Hi, iam Heather Vega, G’day, mate.
## What Are 9 5 Jobs Called? [Solved]
A 9 to 5 job is one that starts at 9 a.m. and goes to 5 p.m. 9 to 5 jobs are thought to be unexciting and low-paid, such as routine office work or a factory job. Similar expressions are “office job,” “regular job” and “blue collar job,” although each of these carry slightly different meanings.11 Jul 2021
