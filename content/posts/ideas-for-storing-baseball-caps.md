Conclusion: Sum up main points.
Concluding an essay is like tying a bow on a present: it brings everything together and leaves the reader with a sense of closure. A good conclusion summarizes the main points of your essay in a concise and creative way. It leaves the reader with something to think about, whether it’s a new perspective on your topic, or a call to action. Here are some tips for writing a strong conclusion:
 Restate your thesis in different words.

Summarize your main points.

Make sure your conclusion is as strong as your introduction.

End with a bang! Leave the reader with something to remember.

A good conclusion can be the difference between an essay that’s just okay and one that really stands out. So don’t underestimate the importance of writing a great one!

1st idea:
Ideas are the lifeblood of any business. Without fresh ideas, businesses would quickly become stagnant and fail to thrive. Though generating new ideas can be challenging, it is essential for businesses to keep the flow of ideas going in order to stay relevant and succeed.
There are a few ways to generate new ideas. One way is to hold brainstorming sessions with employees. This gets everyone in the company thinking about new possibilities and can often lead to some great concepts. Another way to come up with new ideas is to look at what other businesses in your industry are doing and try to improve upon it. Finally, don’t be afraid to think outside the box – sometimes the best ideas come from left field.

If you want your business to stay ahead of the competition, it is imperative that you generate new ideas on a regular basis.

What are the new ideas out there?
There are many new ideas out there, and it can be hard to determine which ones should be introduced into your project. Here are a few tips to help make the decision: 
-Start by asking yourself what you want your project to achieve. If you don’t know yet, consider including goals and target audience in your design.
-Once you have a good idea of what you want, look for potential solutions that could help achieve it. This means identifying problems that need to be solved before anything else can be done, and then thinking of ways to overcome them.
-Finally, consider how much money or time you’ll need to spend on developing the idea before making a decision. If it’s something you think will cost less than both of those things combined, go for it!
