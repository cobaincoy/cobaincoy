Memory exercise: How can we improve our memory and concentration?
Memory is an important skill that we can use to improve our concentration and memory. Here are some ways to improve our memory:
1. Eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. These foods help to create a strong immune system and keep our brains healthy.

2. Get enough exercise. Exercise has been shown to improve cognitive function and mental clarity.

3. Use brain teasers or mental puzzles to keep your mind active and engaged. Brain teasing tasks include things like finding the pattern in a jumble of numbers, solving complex math problems, or making decision trees.

4. Practice gratitude every day for all the good in our lives. Gratitude can boost mood, focus, and creativity; it can also help us remember positive experiences from past times.

Patenting andprotecting inventions
Patents protect inventions from being infringing by others. Patent applications are often filled out in a variety of different ways, including but not limited to, the following: 
-Inventor biography 
-Chemical formula 
-Description of invention 
-Problem to be solved 
-Steps and method for solving the problem 
-Grant of patent 
When an inventor fills out a patent application, they are typically taking on a lot of risk. They could potentially face lawsuits if their invention is copied or used without permission. To help protect their invention, many inventors choose to patent their ideas instead of just selling them outright. By filing a patent application, an inventor is able to make sure that their invention is protected from infringement and can also get feedback from potential customers or partners about how their product might work.

History of Invention: How did invention come about?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that had not been considered before. Invention has been around for centuries, and it began with the Greeks. In their manual The Iliad, Homer mentions the invention of the bow and arrow, which he says was created by Menelaus. Other ancient authors also mention the invention of new technologies. For example, Theophrastus wrote about a machine that could turn any object into wine, which he called the “Wine Maker”. The Chinese also invented various products such as silkworm cocoons and books in the 4th century BC.
