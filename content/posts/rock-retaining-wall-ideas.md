What is creative?
Creativity is a complex and subjective concept. Some people might say that creativity is the ability to come up with ideas or solutions that are new and different from what has been done before. Others might say that creativity is simply coming up with new ways to do something. There is no right or wrong answer, it just depends on how you define creativity.

The creative process: How does one go about coming up with an invention?
Invention ideas come to us in all forms- written, verbal, or graphical. Some people start with the idea of what they want to create and then work backwards from there. Others have a pure invention idea that is completely new and has no precedent within the industry. There is no right or wrong way to come up with an invention, as long as it's creative and futuristic. The process of coming up with an invention begins by brainstorming different ideas on paper or on a computer. Once you've collected a few good ideas, it's time to get them down on paper or in your head for further thought. Once you've created some rough sketches, it's time for refinement and development. The next step is testing- doing research on the subject matter you're consideringbefore submitting your product to market.

How can we make our ideas into actual products or services?
In business, big ideas are the life blood of startups. They can turn into successful products or services with a bit of effort and creativity. But how do you make your big ideas into reality? Here are three tips:
1) Get help from a marketer: A good marketer can help you identify potential customers and convert them into paying customers.

2) Take your time: Start with small, achievable goals first and then move on to more ambitious ones as you get closer to your target market.

3) Be creative: Be open to new ideas and don't be afraid to experiment. If you can come up with an effective way to solve a problem or reach a new audience, your idea will be more likely to succeed than if you try something that's already been done before.

The brainstroming phenomenon is a curious and sometimes inexplicable phenomenon that can be observed when people are thinking deeply or concentrating on a task. The most common form of brainstroming is when someone's thoughts flow evenly and smoothly from one area of their mind to another. However, there are also cases where thoughts shift abruptly and randomly different parts of the brain can fire simultaneously. This sudden switch in focus can cause people to achieve great insights or achieve goals they never thought possible.
