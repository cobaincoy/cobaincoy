How to make a quilt top
A quilt top is an easy and versatile project that can be completed in a few hours or even less. There are many different ways to do this project, so there is no need to be afraid of experimentation. Here are some examples: 

-You can use batting or fabric scraps to create the fabric backing for your quilt top. This will add some extra stability and durability to your finished product. 
-You can easily make using pie crusts instead of batting or fabric scraps. Just cut out the dough and place it in a greased pie dish. Freeze for 30 minutes or until solidified. Cut out the desired designs and place them on the pie crusts. 
-You can also use whipped cream as a filling for your quilt top.
