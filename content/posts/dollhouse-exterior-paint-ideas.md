The Psychology of Idea Generation
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that all people have in common. They all want to create something new and exciting, and they all feel like they can do it. This is where creativity comes into play. People are able to come up with ideas on their own, but often they need help coming up with the best ones. Here are four ways to get creative juices flowing:
1. Take on a smaller project: Sometimes the best way to get started with an idea is by taking on a smaller project that you can complete quickly and easily. This will help you get your head around the concept and start thinking about ways that you could improve it.

2. Draw on your experience: When you have some experience under your belt, it becomes easier to come up with powerful ideas.

Definition of Innovation: How does innovation differ from traditional methods?
There are a few key distinctions between innovation and traditional methods when it comes to how it is defined. Innovation typically refers to new or different ways of doing something, while traditional methods usually refer to older, more common ways of doing things. Some other key differences include that innovation often involves trying different things out and seeing what works, while traditional methods often rely on certainties and expectations which can often lead to disappointment. Despite these differences, however, both types of innovation can have important implications for businesses and society as a whole.

The process of innovation
Innovation is a process that can be divided into four distinct stages: ideation, development, implementation, and diffusion.
Ideation is the stage in which new ideas are generated. This can involve brainstorming sessions, market research, or simply observing the world around you. Once an idea has been generated, it must be developed. This stage includes testing the feasibility of the idea and refining it until it is ready to be implemented.

Implementation is when the innovative idea is put into practice. This stage can be challenging, as it requires bringing the idea to life and making it work within the context of your business or organisation. Diffusion is the final stage of innovation, and refers to how widely the new idea is adopted. This stage is often influenced by factors such as marketing and word-of-mouth.

What is creativity?
Creativity is the process of coming up with new ideas, concepts or solutions to problems. It can be defined in many ways, but often it refers to the ability to come up with something new and original. Creative people are often thought of as those who are able to come up with new and innovative ideas, but that’s not all that creativity involves. In fact, creativity can also refer to the ability to approach problem solving in a different way or the ability to come up with innovative ways of tackling old problems.
So what exactly is creativity? It’s an adjective that can describe a wide range of things, but many experts believe that creativity is key to success both professionally and personally. There are several components to creativity: time management, planning and focus.
