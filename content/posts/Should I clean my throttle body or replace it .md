Hola, iam Randy Matsuno, Hope you're doing well!
## Should I Clean My Throttle Body Or Replace It? [Solved]
Generally, throttle bodies do not need to be replaced completely, but rather just need specific parts related to them replaced. I would also recommend checking the mass air flow sensor to be sure it is functioning correctly as well since this could also cause the car to hesitate or run poorly.29 Sept 2016
