Patent and Patenting in Invention
Patenting is a process of making a claim to an invention. A patent gives the inventor the exclusive right to use the invention for the lifetime of the patent, or until someone else patents it. Patents can be granted for any sort of invention, from simple ideas to complex technology. While it can be expensive and time-consuming to get a patent, being able to use a patented invention can give you an edge in competition.

Different brainstorming techniques
When it comes to brainstorming, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. The best way to brainstorm depends on the situation and the type of project you’re working on. Here are three different brainstorming techniques to try:
1. Brainwriting

Brainwriting is a great option when you need to generate a lot of ideas quickly. To brainwrite, each person in the group writes down their ideas on a piece of paper. Then, everyone passes their paper to the person next to them, who adds their own ideas. This continues until everyone has had a chance to add to all of the ideas.

2. Round Robin

The round robin technique is similar to brainwriting, but with one key difference: instead of passing around a piece of paper, each person takes turns verbally sharing their ideas with the group.
