Immigration and globalization: How will these issues affect the workforce and social stability?
In the year 2022, immigration and globalization will have a significant impact on the workforce and social stability. With more people moving to countries such as China and India, there is an increased demand for workers. This has led to a rise in the number of jobs available in these countries, but also a decrease in the number of people who can actually fill them. Additionally, the growth of technology has made it easier for people to move around the world, which has created new opportunities for those who are unable or unwilling to find work in their home country. These changing demographics will have a significant impact on both the workforce and social stability.

What are the best ways to have ideas?
Ideas are the lifeblood of any startup. Without them, startups can't achieve their goals and achieve success. Here are 8 ways to have more ideas:
1. Take a walk around your neighbourhood. This will help you get a mental picture of what your business could look like and how it could Benefit the neighbourhood.
2. Get involved in community activities. Volunteering your time and energy to organisations that you believe in is a great way to get ideas for your business from people who already care about the world you're trying to build for them. 
3. Do some brainstorming with friends or family members. These conversations can help you come up with various concepts for your business, which can then be turned into realisations through brainstorming with others.
