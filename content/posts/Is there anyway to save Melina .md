## Is There Anyway To Save Melina? [Solved]
Consuming Miquella's Needle will permanently remove the Flame of Frenzy. And getting the Frenzied Flame is the only way you can save Melina because she will leave you at this point. Then instead of her sacrifice at the Forge to burn the Erdtree, your body is sacrificed.21 Apr 2022
