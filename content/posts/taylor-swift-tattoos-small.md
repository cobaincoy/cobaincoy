How Invention Works: Invention can come from anything from a simple change in the way something works to creating a new product or technology.
Invention is the process of creating a new product or technology from something that already exists. It can come from a simple change in the way something works, or from creating a new market for an existing product. In both cases, innovation can mean big changes for both those who create it and society as a whole.

Tips for staying creative
Creativity is key to any business. Whether you're a creative individual or a small business owner, staying creative is essential for success. Here are some tips to help you stay creative: 
1. Consider your target audience: When thinking about how to be creative, it's important to consider what your target audience is. What are they interested in? What can you share with them that will interest them? This information can help you create content that will resonate with your audience. 

2. Create interesting ideas: When you have an idea for something, don't just go with the first thing that comes into your mind. Instead, think of ways that you could make this idea even more interesting and unique. This could involve coming up with different ideas for products or services, or creating a new concept that nobody has thought of before.
