The Idea: What is your business using that isn't working and why?
A business is using an idea that is not working because it does not fit their own needs or the needs of their customer base. There are many different ideas for businesses that do not work, and it is important to find what does not work for your business before you make any changes. There are a few key factors to consider when looking for a new idea:
1) What do you need the product or service to do that nobody else has?
2) What are your customer's needs?
3) What do you think your potential customers will like or need?
4) How will you be able to create and shipped the product or service?
