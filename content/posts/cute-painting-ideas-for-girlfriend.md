The power of big Ideas
Big ideas are the lifeblood of businesses and organizations. They can help change the course of history, create new products or services, solve difficult problems or change the way we live.
Here are four ways big ideas can help your business: 
1. Brainstorm new ideas with a group: With a few simple questions, you can generate dozens or even hundreds of potential ideas for your business. This way, you'll have a greater chance of coming up with something that will be interesting and innovative.
2. Test out new concepts: Once you've generated a number of potential ideas, it's time to test them out in an real-world situation. This means trying out different models, scenarios and models of how these products or services could work in order to see if they're actually feasible and profitable.

Methodology: How will we test and measure the results?
Testing and measuring the results is an important step in any business. It allows you to know how your product or service is performing and whether it is meeting your expectations. There are many different ways to test and measure the results of a business, but one common approach is to use surveys. Surveys can be used to measure customer satisfaction, abandon rates, and more.
There are a few factors you should consider when choosing a survey technique. For example, do you want to target specific demographics? Or do you want to gather data from a large number of people? Finally, will you be able to release the results publicly? If so, public Release Testing (PRT) may be the best technique for you. PRT allows you to release your findings as soon as possible after testing so that everyone can see what worked and what didn’t.

What is brainstroming? Brainstroming is a phenomenon that occurs when people are2006

The term "brainstroming" has been around for quite some time, but it wasn't until 2006 that the term was coined to describe the phenomenon of individuals being overwhelmed by a single task or idea. The name comes from a phrase used by Eisenhower in his Farewell Address in 1961, where he spoke about the "massive national effort" which was needed to meet the challenges of the future. Brainstroming can be defined in many ways, but its most common definition would say that individuals are struggling to focus on one thing and unable to complete any other tasks. This can lead to an overall feeling of overwhelm or stress. It's important to note that not all people experience brainstroming at different times or in different ways.
