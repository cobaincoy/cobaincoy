The future of inventions: What needs to be done in order for new inventions to thrive?
Inventions have always been a part of humanity’s history, but as the world has become more complex, so too has the need for new inventions. This is especially true in today’s world, where technology is constantly evolving and becoming more advanced. In order for new inventions to thrive, however, there are several key things that need to be done. 
One of the most important things that needs to be done is to make sure that new inventions are passed on from one generation to the next. This can be done by creating a system where people can share ideas for new inventions with each other, and then testing and dubbing them into products or services. It also helps to create a market for these products or services by attracting investors who can help to bring these products or services to market quickly.
