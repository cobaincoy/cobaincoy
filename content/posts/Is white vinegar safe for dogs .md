## Is White Vinegar Safe For Dogs? [Solved]
Dogs can have distilled white vinegar or apple cider vinegar (ACV) as long as you use it in moderation. Serve your dog one tablespoon of diluted vinegar in their water bowl or let it soak into their kibble. Keep in mind there is always the possibility your specific dog might have an allergy or intolerance to vinegar.14 Jun 2022
