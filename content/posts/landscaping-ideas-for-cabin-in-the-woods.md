Contemporary Inventions: The computer, the internet, 3D printing
Invention is the key to progress. It is what takes us from the horse and buggy to the automobile, from telegraphs to telephones, from mainframe computers to laptops. And it is what has given us 3D printing, a technology that has the potential to change manufacturing as we know it.
3D printing is an additive manufacturing process, which means that it builds objects by adding layers of material one at a time. This is in contrast to subtractive manufacturing processes like CNC machining, which involve cutting away material to create an object.

3D printing has been around for decades, but it has only recently become accessible to consumers and small businesses. Thanks to advances in 3D printer technology and the availability of affordable 3D printers, this transformative technology is now within reach of anyone with an idea and a bit of creativity.

The benefits and drawbacks of DIY projects
There are many benefits to DIY projects, including the satisfaction of completing something yourself. However, there are also some drawbacks to DIY projects, which can include a lack of knowledge or experience, and even mistakes. Here are four tips for avoiding common pitfalls when creating your own DIY project:
1. Do your research first: When starting a DIY project, it’s important to do your research before starting any project. You don’t want to spend hours trying to figure out how something works only to have it go wrong later on. By doing your research, you can save yourself time and headaches in the long run.

2. Be patient: Don’t be discouraged if you don’t understand something right away. If you can be patient and continue reading instructions, you will eventually get the hang of things.
