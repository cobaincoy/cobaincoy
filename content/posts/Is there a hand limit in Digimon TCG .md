Hi, iam Stanley Aragon, Hope you're doing well!
## Is There A Hand Limit In Digimon Tcg? [Solved]
How many cards can I have in my Hand? There is no upper limit to the amount of cards you can have in your Hand. Can I choose not to Hatch a Digitama or Move my LV3 or above Digimon from Raising Area to Battle Area on purpose? Yes, Hatching Digitama and Moving Digimons to Battle Area or not in this phase is your choice.24 Apr 2020
