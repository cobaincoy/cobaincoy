Definition of invention:
Inventions are creative ideas that come about as a result of a person's efforts. They can be things like a new product or service, or just some new technology. Inventions can have a lot of different meanings, depending on the person who created it. For example, a clothing company might create a new style that is different from all the others out there. Or, someone might come up with a new way to make something work. There are so many different definitions for inventions, it's hard to say which one is the most accurate. But, whatever the definition may be, an invention is always something good that somebody came up with to improve the world.

Overcoming creative blocks:
When it comes to creative blocks, the best way to overcome them is to be prepared with a toolkit of ideas. This way, when you hit a wall, you have something to fall back on. Here are four tips for ensuring that your toolkit is always full:
1. Be curious and ask questions: When you're stuck, it's often because you're not sure what you want to achieve. Asking yourself - and others - questions can help clarify your goals, and open up new possibilities for how to achieve them.

2. Take inspiration from others: A great way to jump-start your own creativity is to look at what others have done. See what inspires you, and then adapt those ideas to your own purposes.

3. Give yourself time and space: Rushing into things rarely leads to good results.
