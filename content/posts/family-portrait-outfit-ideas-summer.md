The power of creativity
Creativity is one of the most powerful forces in the universe. It is the ability to see things differently, to make connections that others don’t see, and to come up with new ideas and solutions.
Creativity is what allows us to solve problems, to invent new technologies, and to create works of art that move and inspire us. It is the engine of progress. And it is something that we all have within us.
