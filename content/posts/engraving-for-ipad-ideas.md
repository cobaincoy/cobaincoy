Introduce the topic of inventions.
Inventions are ideas or objects that are created with the purpose of solving a problem or making life easier. Inventors are people who come up with these ideas and create them.
Some inventions are world-changing, like the telephone or the airplane. Others solve more everyday problems, like a better mousetrap or a self-tying shoelace. No matter how big or small, all inventions start with an idea.

If you have an invention idea, the first step is to figure out if it’s something that people actually need or want. Once you’ve done that, it’s time to start working on making your invention a reality.

The Importance of Innovation
Innovation is important for several reasons. First, without innovation businesses would become stagnant and eventually fail. To stay competitive, businesses must be constantly moving forward and improving upon their current offerings. Additionally, innovation can lead to new and improved products and services that customers will demand. Finally, innovation can help businesses to cut costs and improve efficiency.
In order to be successful, businesses must embrace innovation. Those that don’t will likely find themselves struggling to keep up with their competitors. Those that do will be well-positioned to take advantage of new opportunities and continue growing.
