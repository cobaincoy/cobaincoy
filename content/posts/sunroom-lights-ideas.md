Summary: What are some tips for staying creative in the workplace?
Creativity is key to staying creative in the workplace. There are a few pieces of advice that can help you be more productive and innovative. Here are some tips:
1. Find ways to get out of your comfort zone. When you’re stuck in a rut, try going against the grain and trying something new. This will force you to think outside the box and come up with ideas that may not have been considered before.

3. Take time for yourself breaks.
