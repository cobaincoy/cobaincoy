The definition of art: Who makes it and what does it represent?
Creative art is a term that has been bandied about for a long time, with no one really having a clear definition of what it actually means. In many cases, it seems to be subjective and up to the artist themselves what constitutes as creative art. However, in spite of its nebulous nature, there are some key factors that seem to be essential to the definition of creative art. These include the artists' own personal vision and feelings towards their work, as well as the medium or technique used. Whether it's painting or sculpture, music or photography - any form of creative art can be said to have its own unique meaning and personality.

How to brainstorm effectively
In order to brainstorm effectively, it is important to keep an open mind and be willing to think outside the box. Creativity is key when brainstorming, so try not to get too bogged down in the details. Instead, focus on coming up with creative solutions to the problem at hand.
