The concept of brainstroming: what it is, how it works, and how to use it
Brainstroming is a term that refers to the act of focusing one’s attention on one specific topic and then taking deep, calming breaths. It can be used as a tool for focus, relaxation, and problem-solving. Brainstroming can be done in any situation, but it is most effective when used during meditation or stress relief. Here are five tips for using brainstroming to achieve success:
