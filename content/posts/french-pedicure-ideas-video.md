The four types of creativity: Visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and olfactory.
Creative art is something that helps to express yourself and your thoughts. There are four different types of creativity which can be expressed through visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and olfactory means. Each type of creative expression has its own strengths and weaknesses. Visual creativity is often seen as the most direct form of creative expression. This type of creativity is often used to create artworks that are representational or specific to a certain era or culture.Auditory creativity is often used when artists need to connect with their audience in order to express their ideas. This type of creativity can be used for music, sound design, and audio production. Kinesthetic creativity is often used when artists need to explore new ways to experience the world around them. This type of creativity can be used for sculptures, dance, and performance art.

Different types of innovation: What are some common examples?
Innovation is a term that has been used for centuries to describe different types of change. Different types of innovation can be described in two ways: product and process innovation. Product innovation refers to the development of a new product, while process innovation refers to the improvement of a process, such as adding new technology or modifying an existing one. 
Product innovation usually occurs when two companies come up with a new product that is better than what was before. Process innovation, on the other hand, often happens when companies try to improve an existing process so it can be more efficient and accurate. This can involve adding new technology or changing how an old process is run.
