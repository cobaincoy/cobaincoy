Hi, iam Jason Stark, May your day be joyful.
## Is Zoe Early Or Late Game? [Solved]
Zoe burns mana EXTREMELY fast early game, don't waste your E without knowing you will be able to hit them. Make sure you are last hitting minions, and try to deny your opponent CS by auto attacking them when they come in to take a minion. At level 6, you can start finishing people with your auto attacks.28 Jun 2022
