Ideas for Home Improvements: From changing lightbulbs to installing awnings, there are many options.
Diy Home Improvements: From changing lightbulbs to installing awnings, there are many options to improve your home. Here are some ideas for you to get started: 
1. Change your light bulbs: A simple change can make all the difference in how your home looks and feels. Use a switch or transformer to turn CFLs into LEDs, or use an old incandescent bulb to get a new, more energy-efficient investment. 

2. Add insulation: When it comes to heating and cooling systems, insulation is essential. Put up some thermal insulation foam if you need extra warmth or protection from the elements outside. Or install a window air conditioner with insulation so the cold air doesn’t enter your home as easily as the hot air.
