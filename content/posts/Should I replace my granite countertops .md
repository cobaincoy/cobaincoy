## Should I Replace My Granite Countertops? [Solved]
 Granite is durable and doesn't easily scratch or burn. However, as with any natural stone, wear and tear will occur over time. Daily use in the kitchen can cause chips, stains, cracks, or loss of lustre. No matter the damage, it is always cheaper to restore and refinish, rather than replace granite countertops.
