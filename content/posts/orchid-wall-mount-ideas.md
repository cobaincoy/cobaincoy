How can we turn big ideas into reality?
How can we turn big ideas into reality? There is no one answer to this question, as the process of turning big ideas into real world solutions will vary depending on the individual and organization. However, some tips on how to make this happen include:
1) Taking the time to think through and come up with a good idea. This means taking the time to think about what could be done, and not just what you’re thinking right now. It can be helpful to have a goal in mind before starting any project, so that you know you won’t get sidetracked.

2) being clear about what you want. Once you have a good idea of what you want, it's important to be sure that everyone involved knows what they need to do in order for that idea to become a reality.
