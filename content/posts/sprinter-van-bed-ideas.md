The definition of creativity and how to achieve it: What is needed for creative achievement?
Creativity is a complex and multi-layered concept. To achieve it, one typically needs to possess several components that are usually interconnected. One of the most important qualities needed for creativity is imagination. Imagination can be used to come up with new ideas or solutions, as well as to generate new concepts or plans. It is also necessary to have an understanding of what one wants to create, and how best to do so. The second component of creativity is problem-solving. When faced with a difficult challenge, it is often helpful to have a plan and know what steps need to be taken in order to complete the task at hand. Finally, creativity often requires time and effort.
