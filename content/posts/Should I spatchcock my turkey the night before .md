Hola, iam Jessica Henesey, Have a blessed day.
## Should I Spatchcock My Turkey The Night Before? [Solved]
To save yourself some roasting time, you can spatchcock your turkey the day before. Just set it onto a baking sheet and leave it in the fridge uncovered overnight. Rub it with a little salt for a dry brine and allow the cold air to dry up the skin. This results in the ultimate crispy skin.17 Nov 2020
