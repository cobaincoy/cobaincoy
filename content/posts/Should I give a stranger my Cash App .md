## Should I Give A Stranger My Cash App? [Solved]
Avoid direct messaging with strangers promising to reward you with a cash prize. In the event that you get an email or text message announcing you've won a prize or reward but need to send money first, don't click on any links. Never agree to send someone money or make a purchase in return for a payment or reward.13 Jun 2022
