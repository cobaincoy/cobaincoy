History of Invention: How has invention evolved?
Invention has been a part of human history for as long as people have existed. Evolution has played a role in shaping the way that Invention works, and how it is used. Invention has come in many forms, from simple methods to complex products. 
Some of the most important inventions include the wheel, the telephone, and the refrigerator. Each of these devices had a large impact on society and individual lives. The wheel was an important invention because it allowed people to move around more easily and build roads and bridges. The telephone was an important invention because it allowed people to communicate with each other without having to leave their homes or go to a library. The refrigerator was an important invention because it allowed people to store food without having to go into the kitchen. 

The importance of Invention cannot be understated.

How can you come up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to make something new. Whether it’s coming up with a new product idea, coming up with a catchy headline or coming up with an innovative way to solve a problem, creativity is key. This can be hard to come by, but there are a few ways to get started. Here are five tips for coming up with creative ideas:
1. Take your time
Don’t rush your ideas. Take your time brainstorming and designing what you want your product or headline to say. This will help you focus on the right things and come up with ideas that are both interesting and well-conceived.

2. Be open to feedback
Before you finalize any of your ideas, take some feedback from friends, family or colleagues.

The Challenge of Innovation: How do we ensure that innovations are successful?
Innovation has always been a challenge. What makes it so difficult is that it often hinges on the right decisions and the right team. Today, with advancements in technology, innovation is even more important. Here are three challenges that need to be overcome if innovation is to succeed:
1. The Myth of the One True Idea
 knapsackers faced a similar challenge when they sought ways to improve their productivity. “There was only one way to do it, and that was by following the recipe,” says Allen Weinberg, MIT mathematician and co-author of The Art of Computer Programming. Even today, some companies continue this paradigm by insisting on using only one approach for every product or service. This limits creativity and variety in the marketplace, which can lead to success or failure in innovation.

The art of creativity: What artists do and why they do it
Creativity is a wide and varied term, but it typically refers to the ability of artists to produce new works of art. This can be in the form of paintings, sculptures, photography, etc. but also in the form of ideas or concepts that are not necessarily physical. In many ways, creativity is an innate quality that all humans possess. It is something that is passed down from one generation to the next and something that can be cultivated through practice and hard work. While some people may find creativity a challenge to achieve, for others it can be a source of inspiration and guidance.
