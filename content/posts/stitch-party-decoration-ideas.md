It can be a simple process or a huge undertaking, and it can be something that someone came up with on their own or something that was patented. Inventions have come from many different sources, including people who had nothing to do with marketing or design, and from a lot of different fields.

What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways to cook, Tate Modern’s newest art gallery or a new way of travelling. Here are some of our favourites:
1. A creative way to relax: take a walk in nature. This can involve finding a meadow with plenty of trees, sitting under a tree and taking in the natural sounds.

2. Experiment with different food preferences: try out different recipes or eat something that you’ve never tried before. This will open your eyes to what foods you like and how they taste.

3. Get creative with your time: use up time by doing something creative like painting, drawing or sculpting. This will help you de-stress and get lost in thought for a little bit.

Introduce the topic of invention.
Invention is the process or art of creating something new, whether it is a physical object, a piece of software, or a process. It is an important part of human history and has played a significant role in our development as a species.
Invention is not just about coming up with something new; it is also about improving upon existing ideas and technologies. This can be seen in the way that many inventions are built upon the work of previous inventors. For example, the Wright brothers were able to build upon the work of earlier aviation pioneers to create the first successful airplane.

Invention is also about solving problems. Inventors are often motivated by a desire to solve a particular problem that they have encountered in their own lives. This was the case with Benjamin Franklin, who invented the lightning rod after being struck by lightning himself.

3) The Best Way
When you are looking for the best way to do something, it is always important to take your time and consider all of the options. There are many ways to do something, and it is important to find the one that will work best for you. Here are three examples of how taking your time can help you choose the best way to go about a task: 
-Consider what you want the final product to look like. Not everything needs to be done in one fell swoop, and there may be several steps that need to be taken in order for the project to come together. This will allow you to make sure that each step is executed perfectly and without any mistakes.

-Take your time planning out every step of the process. This will ensure that each step carries with it a certain level of importance and that there are no surprises along the way.
