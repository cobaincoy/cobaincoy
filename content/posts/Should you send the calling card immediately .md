## Should You Send The Calling Card Immediately? [Solved]
Only send the calling card when you're absolutely sure you're ready to return to the Palace the next day and face the boss. You get one chance to do this, and when you send your calling card and steal the treasure, the palace will go away.5 Apr 2017
