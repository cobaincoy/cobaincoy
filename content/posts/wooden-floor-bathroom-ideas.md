What is invention?
Invention is an act or process of coming up with a new solution to a problem. Invention has come from many different places, including science, business and creativity. Today, invention is used more often in technology than it ever has been before. 
Invention can be something as simple as making a new product or service or taking an idea and turning it into a reality. Sometimes invention comes from the simplest things- like coming up with a better way to chop wood. Other times, it takes longer but is more complex- like coming up with a new way to print money or create new ways to store information. 

But whatever the case, when someone comes up with an innovative solution, that’s something special. It shows they have think outside the box and are willing to try somethingnew just to see if it works.

The definition of invention has changed over time
Invention is an act or process of creating a new product or service from scratch. The definition of invention has changed over time, and the definition of what constitutes an invention has also changed.  In 1876, the International Convention on Patents gave a definitive definition of an invention: "A new production method, composition, use or application of any natural or artificial material." 
However, in 1992, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) revised its rules on what constituted an invention. Previously, inventions were considered to be "natural phenomena" that had not been produced by man. However, under this revision, "natural phenomena" no longer had to be novel; they could just be useful products that had not been used before.

What are creative ideas?
Creative ideas are a powerful tool that can help you achieve your goals. You can find many different creative ideas online, and there are many ways to use them. Here are some of the best:  
- Creative packaging: Many people think that creativity comes when someone comes up with a new idea for a product or service. However, this is not always the case. Sometimes, creative ideas come from looking at something from a different perspective. For example, if you were to redesign your favorite restaurant’s logo, you might come up with an inventive design that is more eye-catching and efficient than the original. 
- Branding: One of the most important things that businesses do is to create brand equity. This means creating a name for your company and making it known to other businesses in your industry.
