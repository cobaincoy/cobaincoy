How can we create big ideas?
There are a lot of ways to create big ideas. You can think of big ideas as potential solutions to problems that you don't know how to solve. Ideas can come from anywhere, and you don't have to be creative or innovative to come up with them. What's important is that you have a good understanding of the problem, and the potential solutions you could consider. Here are some tips on how to generate big ideas:
1. Think about what people want or need. Once you know what people want or need, it's easier to start thinking about possible solutions that might address those needs. This will help you determine which problems might be best solved by creating a new product or service, or by improving an existing one.

2. Consider who your target market is.

Conclusion: We need to start thinking big when it comes to ideas.
We need to start thinking big when it comes to ideas. If we don't, we're going to get stuck in a rut and never be able to break out of it. There are so many great ideas out there that we just can't put our finger on what to do with them all. So how do we go about finding the ones that will work for us? There are a few things that we can do in order to help ourselves get started: 
1) Take some time for yourself – We all have moments where we feel like we don't have time for anything. But if you take the time to step away from your work or project and relax, you'll usually find yourself with more inspiration than you ever thought possible. It's important to remember that if you're not taking care of yourself, you're going to suffer in the long run.
