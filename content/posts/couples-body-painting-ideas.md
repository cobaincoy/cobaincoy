Invention and Technology- What is the difference?
There is a big difference between invention and technology. Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, while technology is the use of that idea to make something happen. Invention can be anything from a simple solution to a complex product or service. Shelly Korman, an inventor and business owner, said that invention is the “f initest and simplest form of creativity.” It can be something as simple as coming up with an idea for a product or service, or coming up with a way to do something better than what someone else has done before. Technology, on the other hand, can be anything from making something work better than it ever has before to creating artificial intelligence (AI). There are so many different ways that technology can be used, and there is no one right way to use them all.

The Idea: Why is this better than the old way?
The old way of doing things is not always the best way. There are new ideas that can be better than what we have been using. Some of these ideas are change management, software development, and product delivery. Change management is the process of designing, implementing, and monitoring a change management plan to ensure that changes are made in a safe and timely manner. Software development is the process of creating, testing, and maintaining software applications. The goal of software development is to provide end users with products that they can use safely and efficiently. Product delivery is the process of bringing products to market as quickly as possible so that customers can enjoy their products. The goal of product delivery is to provide customers with the best possible experience when using their products.
