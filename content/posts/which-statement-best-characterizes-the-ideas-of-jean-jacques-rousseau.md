Invention is the process of creating something new, whether it is a product, a process, or a solution to a problem. Inventors are those who come up with new ideas and turn them into reality. The invention process often begins with an idea, which is then developed through research and experimentation. Once an invention is created, it must be patented to protect the inventor's rights.
