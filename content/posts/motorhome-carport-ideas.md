The power of creative thinking
We often hear that creative thinking is a valuable skill in the modern workplace. But what is creative thinking, and why is it so important?
Creative thinking can be defined as “thinking outside the box” – coming up with new ideas and solutions that are not immediately obvious. This type of thinking is essential in today’s rapidly changing world, where businesses need to constantly innovate to stay ahead of the competition.

There are many ways to encourage creative thinking in yourself and others. Some common methods include brainstorming, problem solving, and looking at problems from different perspectives. By fostering a culture of creativity in your workplace, you can make it a more innovative and dynamic place to work.

Conclusion: The importance of big ideas
In any field, be it history or physics, there are certain big ideas that provide a framework for understanding the subject. In history, for example, the big ideas might include causes of historical events, or different interpretations of the past. In physics, the big ideas might include the laws of motion or the principles of energy.
Big ideas are important because they give us a way to make sense of complex information. They help us see the connections between different concepts and see how they fit together to form a coherent whole. Without big ideas, we would be lost in a sea of facts and data.

So next time you're struggling to understand a concept, ask yourself: what is the big idea? Once you have that, everything else will start to fall into place.
