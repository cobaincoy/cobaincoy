Underlying drivers of innovation: The need for new information, technology, or business models
Innovation is what makes businesses and societies successful. It allows for new products, services, or ideas to be developed and offered to the public. However, without innovation, businesses can quickly lose their competitive edge and society can become more stagnant. There are several underlying drivers of innovation that must be considered if we want to see continued success for our industries and societies.
New information technology is vital for businesses in order to increase efficiency and innovate faster. Technologies like chatbots and AI have the potential to change how customers interact with businesses, making them more likely to choose a business over another option. By increasing efficiency and reducing customer friction, businesses can sell more products and services at a lower cost.

Technology also plays a vital role in the development of new business models.

Creative process: What are the four steps?
Creative process is key to any creative endeavors. There are four steps that go into creating a masterpiece: 1) Defining the problem or goal. This will help you come up with a strong plan of how you will solve the problem, 2) Crafting the solution or idea. This can be done through brainstorming, exploring different options, and formulating a proposal. 3) Testing and refining the solution or idea. This can involve working on it for hours, weekends, or even weeks until it’s ready for submission to an audience. 4) Sending the solution or idea off to be created by others. Once it’s created by someone else, it needs to be edited, improved upon, and finalized before being published online or as a final product.
