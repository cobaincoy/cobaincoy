What are some common ways to generate ideas?
Ideas can come from a variety of places, including the mind, the heart, or the spirit. They might be sparked by something you see around you or hear in conversation, or they might be made up on your own. But whatever their source, ideas are a powerful thing and can help you think of ways to improve your life or solve a problem. Here are four tips on how to generate more ideas:

When you’re not busy creating, or when it feels like work is taking up all your time and energy, try doing something else that’s both challenging and rewarding. This could be anything from reading an interesting book to taking a walk outside.
