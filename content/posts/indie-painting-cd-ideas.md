Technology transfer: How does technology be transferred from one company to another?
Invention Ideas: 
-One way to move technology between companies is to have a technology transfer agent (TTA) act as a middleman. The TTA helps negotiate and execute the transfer of technology, ensuring that both companies share the benefits of the invention. 
-Another way to move technology between companies is through joint development. If one company has a good idea for a new product, they may want to share it with other companies in order to get ideas for products and services. This way, both companies are able to gain experience with the product before anything is actually created. 
-Finally, there is also the option of transferring technology over the internet. This method allows for quick and easy transfers of technology so that both companies can benefit from each other's inventions.

Ideas are everywhere, and as we get older, we tend to lose touch with them. This is especially true for younger generations who are constantly bombarded with new ideas and technologies. For example, a recent study by Google showed that the average person can think of no more than 3 new ideas per day. It's important to keep your mind active and stocked with new ideas, so you can continue to innovate and create value for your company and the people you work with.

The 5 Types of Ideas: What they are, what they can do, when to use them, and how we can get started
Ideas are a powerful tool that can help us solve problems. Here are five types of ideas to get started with:
1. Problem identifies and solves: This type of idea is used when you have a specific problem to solve, and there are no other options available. For example, if you’re lost and need to find your way home, you might use this type of idea to identify the problem and come up with a plan to fix it.

2. Plan creation: This type of idea is used to create a plan that will help you achieve your goals. In many cases, this plan will include steps that you can take immediately or that will require some planning (such as setting a date for your meeting).
