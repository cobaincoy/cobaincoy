Trends in Business Processes: How will business processes continue to change and impact businesses?
Business processes have always been changing and impactful. However, there are new trends that businesses should be aware of in order to continue to thrive in the future. Examples of these trends include:
1. Automation and artificial intelligence will continue to influence business processes. This will allow businesses to save time and money by using automated tools instead of human employees.

2. New regulations will also impact business processes. These regulations may require businesses to change their ways or face penalties from government officials.

3. The shift from manual work to electronic systems is already affecting business processes. Businesses must be prepared for this trend by implementing software that helps automate tasks and process paperwork electronically.

4. The use of social media has also become an important part of business process development.

The Role of Invention in Economic Development
Invention has been a key part of economic development for centuries. Inventions have allowed for new products and services to be developed and brought to market, which has led to increased profits and economic growth. 
However, as innovation increasingly becomes more important in the modern economy, some researchers are questioning the role of invention in economic development. Some argue that invention is not an essential ingredient for any viable economic system, and that instead it can lead to overutilization and even bankruptcy. Others maintain that while there can be negative consequences to excessive reliance on invention, it is also important to consider the potential benefits of innovation when designing economic systems.
