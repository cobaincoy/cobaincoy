The power of creativity: How does it work?
Creativity is the ability to come up with new and innovative ways of doing things. It can be found in everything from making art to building a business. In many cases, creativity comes from a creative process that starts with thinking out of the box.
One way creativity works is by sparking new ideas. When people are creative, they often have more ideas than they can actually use because they are brainstorming. This allows them to explore different possibilities and come up with new concepts.

Another way creativity works is by providing stimulation. The more ideas someone has, the more likely they are to come up with one that works. This can be found in anything from working on a project to playing games. creatvity also stems from the environment in which someone lives or works. If something provides an opportunity for creativity, people tend to take advantage of it.

Taking Action: How do you take action when you have creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new products to a better way to do things. When you have creative ideas, it can be hard to know what to do with them. Here are three tips for taking action on your ideas:
1. Research your idea thoroughly before starting anything. This will help you understand the feasibility of the idea and whether or not it is something that is possible or even desirable.

2. Make a prototype of your idea. This will give you a rough idea of how your product or service will look and feel. You can then test this out on customers or see if there is enough demand for the idea to actually start manufacturing it.

3. Take action! Once you have some prototypes and data, it’s time to take action!
