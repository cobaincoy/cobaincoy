## Is There A Ditto In Arceus? [Solved]
 Unfortunately, you can't get or catch a Ditto in Pokemon Legends: Arceus. This shapeshifting Pokemon does not exist on the PokeDex and isn't available in the game. While this is a shame for fans of the Pokemon, it does change things up a bit to give you a different gaming experience for the franchise.27 Jan 2022
