Where to find them: Look around you
Invention ideas are everywhere. Look around your home, office, or neighborhood and you’ll find countless potential inventions just waiting to be created. Here are a few tips on where to find invention ideas:
Start by looking at everyday items and thinking about how they could be improved. For example, does your favorite coffee mug have a design flaw that makes it difficult to hold? Could your toothbrush be more ergonomic?

Pay attention to problems you encounter in your daily life. Is there an annoying task that you wish there was a machine to do for you? Is there a product that you can’t find that would make your life easier?

Keep a notebook with you and jot down any ideas that come to mind, no matter how small or silly they may seem. You never know when inspiration will strike!
