Hello, iam Betty Walker, Gâ€™day, mate.
## Is Terraria Or Minecraft Harder To Run? [Solved]
There's no doubt out of the two which is harder. Minecraft's simple combat and more linear way of handling damage and health makes it alot easier than the more complex health and damage system of terraria. Also, in terraria, most enemies outpower you. While Minecraft often relies on ganking to increase difficulty.7 Jul 2016
