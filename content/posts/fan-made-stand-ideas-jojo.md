Inventors and their inventions
Inventors are people who create something new that has never been seen before. They come up with an idea, and then turn that idea into a reality. Inventions can be anything from a simple tool to a life-saving medical device.
Some of the most famous inventors in history are Leonardo da Vinci, Thomas Edison, and the Wright brothers. Da Vinci was an artist and scientist who invented many things, including the helicopter and the tank. Edison is known for inventing the light bulb and the phonograph. The Wright brothers invented the airplane.

Inventors make our world a better place. They help us solve problems and make everyday tasks easier. We owe a lot to these creative thinkers!

Invention as Art: The History of Invention and the Perceptions of the World
Invention is a process of coming up with new ideas or novel concepts that often change the world. It is an important part of society and economy, and has been used for centuries to create new products, services and ways of life. Invention has also been used to define different eras in history, such as the ancient Greeks who invented wine and cheese, the Romans who pioneered engineering and artillery, and the Americans who created radios, automobiles and other technological innovations.
There are a number of different perceptions of invention throughout history. Some people see invention as something that is automatically good, while others view it as something that can be done for profit or pleasure. There is also a significant difference in how people view invention when it comes to technology.

How to have more ideas
The ability to have more ideas is a key skill for any entrepreneur or business person. However, not all ideas are equal and some may be better than others. To find the best ideas, it’s important to assess how well they align with your goals and objectives. Here are three tips on how to have more ideas:
1. Assessment: Without giving your idea too much thought, it’s natural to want to rush into anything without first assessing its potential risks and benefits. The first step in assessing an idea is to understand its key benefits and how they could impact your business or product. Once you know these things, you can determine if the idea has potential for success.

2. Evaluation: Evaluating an idea requires taking the time to figure out what it could do for your business and what challenges you may face along the way.
