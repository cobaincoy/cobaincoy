what brainstorming is, how it can be useful
What is brainstorming?
Brainstorming is a technique that can be used to generate ideas and solutions. It involves a group of people coming together to share ideas and find new ways to solve problems. Brainstorming can be useful in a variety of situations, such as when you're trying to come up with new ideas for a project or when you're trying to find a way to solve a problem.

There are a few things you should keep in mind when you're brainstorming. First, it's important to have an open mind and be willing to share any idea that comes to mind, no matter how crazy it may seem. Second, it's important to build on other people's ideas and try to come up with creative solutions that are outside the box. Finally, don't be afraid to have fun with it!
