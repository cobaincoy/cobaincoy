Idea 2: We need to create more opportunities for people to learn
There are many ways that people can learn new things. Some people learn through books, others through conversation, and still others through online resources. In order to create more opportunities for people to learn, we should consider creating more interactive learning experiences. These experiences could include:
-Teams: A team learning experience is a great way for students to work together and learn from one another.Team building activities can be used in a variety of ways, such asctoring lectures or discussing research papers with classmates.

-Video Lessons: Adding video lessons into classrooms can help students learn by watching it instead of reading it. This type of learning is convenient because students have time to stop and watch the lesson while they are working on other tasks.

-Blogs: Blogging can be a great way for students to share their ideas, thoughts, and experiences with others.
