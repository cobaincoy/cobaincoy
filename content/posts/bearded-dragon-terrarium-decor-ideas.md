Patents can be granted for any sort of invention, from simple ideas to complex technology. While it can be expensive and time-consuming to get a patent, being able to use a patented invention can give you an edge in competition.

The benefits of big ideas: How do they benefit society as a whole?
Big Ideas offer a way to think outside the box and come up with new ideas that can improve society as a whole. There are many benefits to big ideas, both private and public. Here are three of the most common: 
1) They inspire people to think about how they can improve their community and themselves. Big Ideas encourage people to question why things are the way they are and look for ways to make their world a better place. This can lead to change, both in the individual and community levels.

2) They help us confront problems we might not have seen before. Big Ideas give us new perspectives on how to solve problems and bring about change. This can be exciting because it allows us to see solutions that we might not have considered before.

3) They help us connect with others who share our same goals or values.

Evaluation: What factors do you need to consider when evaluation your Ideas?
Creative ideas are a valuable component of any business. However, they can also be a challenge to evaluate and assess. There are many factors you need to consider when evaluating your creative ideas. 
One important factor is the quality of your idea. If your idea is low quality, it will likely not be accepted by potential customers or partners. You must also consider the feasibility of your idea- does it actually have a chance of happening? If not, you may need to rethink your pitch and make sure the idea has enough potential to overcome any challenges. Additionally, you should measure the impact of your idea- is it worth risking money and time just to bring it to life? Finally, you must determine whether or not people will actually use your idea- is it something that people would want in their business? If not, you may need to revise or remove its from consideration.
