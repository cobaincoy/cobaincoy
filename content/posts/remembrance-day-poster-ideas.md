What inspired the inventor to invent their particular invention?
Inventors often have a specific idea in mind when they come up with their invention. It can be anything from a new product to a new way of doing something. Sometimes, an inventor's idea is just too good to ignore. That's what happened to Northrop Grumman Aeronautics company founder Robert Northrop. He came up with the design for the first jet engine in the 1920s, but it wasn't until he patented it that he got his name recognition and fortune.

The barriers to innovation
Innovation is a key driver of economic growth. It allows firms to create new products and services and find new ways of doing things. However, innovation can be difficult to achieve. Firms face a number of barriers when trying to innovate, including a lack of resources, a risk-averse culture, and an unwillingness to change.
One of the biggest barriers to innovation is a lack of resources. Many firms do not have the money or the manpower to invest in new ideas. They may also lack the necessary skills and knowledge. This can make it difficult for them to identify opportunities for innovation and develop new products and services.

Another barrier to innovation is a risk-averse culture. Many firms are reluctant to take risks, preferring instead to stick with tried-and-tested methods.

What is brainstroming and what are the benefits?
There is no single answer to the question of what brainstroming is and what its benefits are, but there are some potential insights that could be gained from understanding the phenomenon.
