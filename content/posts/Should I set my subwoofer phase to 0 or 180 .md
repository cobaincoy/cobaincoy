## Should I Set My Subwoofer Phase To 0 Or 180? [Solved]
The correct setting is the one that yields more bass. You may have to try a few different recordings before you hear any difference, and it might help to turn up the sub's volume level for this test. If you don't hear any difference between the 0 and 180-degree settings, leave the phase control in the 0 position.29 Aug 2012
