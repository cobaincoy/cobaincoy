What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are many dimensions to consider. These can be broken down into four categories: problem, solution, opportunity and impact. 
Problem: How can we make our world a better place? 
Solution: There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question; each person's perspective and situation will dictate the best way to solve a problem. However, there are a few general concepts that can be used in order to determine what type of solution may work best for a given situation. One such concept is called the "Golden Rule." This states that you should do what is right, even if it doesn't make sense at first. 

Opportunity: What are the possible consequences of our actions? 

Impact: What kind of change or impact will our solutions have?

The difference between creativity and inspiration: What are some of the benefits of having more creativity?
Creativity is a term often used to describe different aspects of one’s life. It can be used to describe things like coming up with new ideas, or coming up with solutions to problems. Inspiration, on the other hand, is a more specific word that refers to a feeling or emotion that one experiences when looking at something and thinking about how it could be improved.
There are several benefits of having more inspiration in one’s life. For example, inspiration can help you come up with new ideas and strategies for solving problems. It can also help you feel more motivated and inspired when working on projects. In addition, inspiration can help you become more creative in your own artwork and writing. Finally, inspiration can help you develop your overall business idea or concept.
