Creative ideas can help you feel inspired
Creative ideas can help you feel inspired, and they can be used in different ways to achieve your goals. You can use them to improve your work, your relationship, or anything else that needs inspiration. Here are some ideas for how to get started: 
1. Take a walk around the block. When you’re feeling down, take a walk around the block and think about things that make you happy. This could be something as small as stopping at a nearby park or going for a run in the park, but it will give you some grounding in positive motivation. 
2. Listen to music while you work. Many people find listening to music helpful when they’re trying to focus on their work because it entertains them without having to focus on what they’re doing.
