The definition of creativity: How does it differ from other definitions?
Creativity is a field that encompasses many different definitions, but all of them share one common goal: to produce something new. Whether it’s creativity in the creative process itself or what people mean when they use the word, creativity can be defined in many ways. 
There are many different ways to define creativity, but all of them outline four core concepts: 1) The ability to take inspiration from others and create something new; 2) The ability to come up with solutions that haven’t been tried before; 3) The willingness to experiment and try new things; and 4) The drive to learn and grow. 

The definition of creativity can be very different depending on who you ask, but all of these core concepts are key when examining how creativity is defined in the world.

The power of thought: What makes great ideas?

Whether you're brainstorming a new product idea or coming up with a plan to save your company, it's important to have good thoughts in mind when coming up with new solutions. When you have these positive thoughts in your head, you're more likely to be able to see potential solutions and come up with the best one for your situation.
