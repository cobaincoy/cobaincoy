Types of creativity: How different forms of creativity can be used to create things
Creativity is a wide term, and there are many different ways to define it. Some people might say that creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. Others might say that creativity is the ability to perceive and express what you see in your world. Still others might say that creativity is simply doing something new and exciting. Here are three types of creativity: creative art, creative writing, and creative music.
Creative art can be used for a variety of purposes, from producing works of art to creating stories and songs. Creative writing can be used for personal journals or novels, while creative music can be used to produce soundtracks or sound poems. All three forms of creativity can be used in different ways to create things unique and memorable.

How to develop them: Be creative
Invention ideas don't just come to people in a sudden eureka moment; usually, it's the result of a process of development. If you want to learn how to develop your own invention ideas, there are a few things you can do. 
First, take some time to brainstorm and think about the problems you encounter in your daily life. What would make your life easier? What does not work well or efficiently? Once you have identified some potential areas for improvement, do some research to see if anyone else has had the same idea. 

Next, start thinking about possible solutions to the problem. How could it be fixed? What would be the best way to achieve this? Try to come up with several different ideas, and then evaluate each one. Which one is most feasible? Which one would be the most effective?
