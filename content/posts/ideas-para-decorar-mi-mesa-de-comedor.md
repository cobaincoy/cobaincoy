The future of finance: What will new financial technologies mean for society?
There are a number of new financial technologies that could have a dramatic impact on society in the next few years. Here are four examples:
1. Blockchains: Blockchain technology is a distributed database that allows for secure, transparent and tamper-proof transactions. This could mean big changes for the way money is used, especially in the banking and insurance sectors.

2. Artificial intelligence (AI): AI has already been used to identify and predict stock prices, make financial decisions and even provide human advisors to businesses. It's only going to get more advanced and sophisticated in the future, and with the right applications – such as peer-to-peer marketplaces or taxes – it could also have a huge impact on social issues such as joblessness and poverty.

Conclusion: Is a DIY project right for you?
A do-it-yourself project can be a great way to save money, but it’s not right for everyone. Here are some things to consider before starting a DIY project.
Time: A DIY project will take longer than hiring a professional, so be sure you have the time to commit.

Cost: The initial cost of a DIY project may be cheaper, but if you make mistakes, it can end up costing more in the long run.

Skill Level: Not all projects are created equal. Some are much easier than others. Be honest with yourself about your skill level and whether or not you can handle the project.

Tools and Materials: You’ll need more than just a few tools and materials for most projects. Make sure you have everything you need before starting.
