## What Ball Handle For Pro Dribble Moves 2K22? [Solved]
In NBA 2K22, the requirement to unlock the pro dribble animation moves is an 85 Ball Handle rating, per 2K gameplay director Mike Wang. That means that not only do you need to set the max Ball Handle rating to at least 85 in your build, but you will also need to spend VC in order to upgrade that stat to at least 85.15 Sept 2021
