## Is Pekka Better Than Dragon? [Solved]
Both troops are very good. Although PEKKA's have greater health and damage, which makes them an all-round troop, while dragons are a bit under in both aspects. However, I wouldn't suggest training an all-out PEKKA army because air-units(such as Dragons) may come out of the clan castle.20 Aug 2014
