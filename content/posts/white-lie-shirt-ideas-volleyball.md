Brainstorming: techniques for generating ideas
Generating ideas can be a daunting task, whether you’re starting a new project or looking for ways to improve an existing one. But with a little creativity and some structure, the process can be much less intimidating.
Here are a few brainstorming techniques that can help you generate ideas:

1. Brainstorming with someone else. Collaborating with someone else can help stimulate new ideas and perspectives that you may not have thought of on your own.

2. Use prompts. If you’re struggling to come up with ideas on your own, prompts can be a helpful way to get the creative juices flowing. You can use prompts from books, online resources, or even make up your own.

3. Take a walk. Sometimes the best way to come up with new ideas is to take a break from thinking about it altogether.
