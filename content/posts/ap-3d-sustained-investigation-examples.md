Why we need big ideas
In a world that is constantly moving and changing, it is more important than ever to have big ideas. Big ideas are what drive progress and keep us moving forward. They inspire us to think outside the box and come up with solutions to problems that we never thought possible.
Without big ideas, we would be stuck in the same place, doing the same things over and over again. It is big ideas that push us to do better and be better. They challenge us to think differently and see the world in new ways.

So why do we need big ideas? Because they are what make the world go round. They are what keep us moving forward and progressing as a society. With out them, we would be lost.

What’s in store for the future of technology?
This year, many articles and presentations were made about the future of technology. The topics ranged from the digital age to artificial intelligence and beyond. However, one thing that was conspicuously absent was any discussion on how technology could impact our social lives. 
It seems that many people are still quite unsure of how technology will have an impact on our daily lives. Some believe that it will only be a force for good, while others remain worried about its ability to divide us further along lines of gender, race, and economic status. Some may even see it as a harbinger of great evil - like in the case of AI becoming self-aware and exploiting humans for their own gain. But whatever the future holds, one thing is for sure: tech will have an important role to play.

Creative expression: How can creativity be used to your advantage?
Creativity is an important tool for any business. It can be used to create unique products or services, or to come up with new ideas for marketing campaigns. However, creativity can also be used in a negative way. For example, some businesses use creativity to make their products look bad instead of selling them at a high price. Other businesses use creativity to come up with innovative ways to compete with other companies.
