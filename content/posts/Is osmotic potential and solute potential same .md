Hi, iam Joel Weaver, Have an A+ day.
## Is Osmotic Potential And Solute Potential Same? [Solved]
Solute potential (Ψs), also called osmotic potential, is negative in a plant cell and zero in distilled water. Typical values for cell cytoplasm are –0.5 to –1.0 MPa. Solutes reduce water potential (resulting in a negative Ψw) by consuming some of the potential energy available in the water.8 Jun 2022
