The definition of creative art and how it has no limits
Creative art has no definitive answer or meaning. It is art that is created from the imagination, emotions, and thoughts of an artist. It can be anything that the artist wants it to be, and there are no limits on what can be considered creative art.
Some people may say that creative art is only valid if it is created with a certain purpose or meaning in mind, but that is not the case. The beauty of creative art is that it can be whatever the artist wants it to be, and there are no rules or boundaries that need to be followed.

The sky's the limit when it comes to creative art, and that's what makes it so special. Anyone can create something beautiful and unique, regardless of their skill level or experience.

Brainstorming techniques

Another common brainstorming technique is known as mind mapping. This involves creating a visual representation of ideas, often using colors and images. This can help to stimulate the creative part of the brain and can be used to organize thoughts in a more logical manner.

Lastly, brainstorming can also be done through problem-solving techniques such as SCAMPER. This acronym stands for Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, and Reverse/Rearrange.
