How will you make sure that your content is useful and engaging?
The content of an article should be useful, engaging and interesting to the reader. It should also be clear, concise and easy to read. Here are 8 tips for making sure that your content is useful, engaging and interesting:
1. Take into account the audience you are addressing. What are the interests of your audience? Are they business owners, consumers or both? When writing for a specific audience, make sure to consider what information will be most effective for them.

2. Use clear language and images to help explain your ideas. People understand words more when they can see them clearly. Try using images throughout your article so that readers can visualize the concepts being discussed.

3. Use originality and creativity when creating new ideas. Don’t plagiarize other people’s work – it won’t make your content any better or more engaging.

The impact of technology on society: How will the impact of technology change society?
The impact of technology on society has been debated for years, but no definitive answer exists. In 2022, a group of researchers from Northeastern University released a report which suggests that technology will have a major impact on society. The report reflects on the future of technology and how it will affect different aspects of our lives, including work, education, and family life. 
One potential outcome is that more people will be employed through digital means. This could lead to an increase in income and wealth for those who can afford it, as well as fewer jobs available for those who cannot. It is also possible that this trend will lead to an increase in stress levels and tension within families. This could cause problems such as decreased productivity at work or increased absenteeism. 

Another potential outcome is that society may become more democratic.
