defines what invention ideas are
The definition of an invention idea is up to the inventor. 
There are many different ways to create and patented inventions, so it is important to determine what type of invention you are thinking of creating. There are four main types of inventions: 
1) Product: A product is a physical object that a customer buys or uses. This could be anything from a new appliance to a new car. 
2) Process: This could be anything from baking soda to driving in rain. Inventions that improve or change the way products are made are often called process patents. 
3) Service: Service patents cover ideas that improve the service industry, such as making it easier for customers to find information or resolving problems faster. 
4) Technology: This could include anything from computers to air travel.

The State of Invention Today
Invention is a vital part of our economy and society. Yet, it has been difficult to keep up with the growth of invention. Inventions have become more common, but the number of new ideas remains low. This lack of innovation is costing society billions of dollars each year in lost revenue and jobs.
Despite these costs, there is still a lot that we can learn from the history of invention. For example, some inventions were originally created for no other purpose than to solve a problem. Other inventions were made just for fun or as an experiment. But even the simplest inventions can have big consequences. For example, the Telephone was invented to make communication more efficient and cost-effective. Today, it plays an important role in our lives and economy.

There are several ways to help rise awareness about Invention and keep it alive.

What are some ideas?
When it comes to ideas, there are many to choose from. Here are a few that stand out to us:
-Start with what you know. What are your interests and passions? What do you like and don't like in the world around you? Start with that and work from there.

-Think outside the box. If you're not sure what to do, think about what other people have done or said that might be of interest to you. This can give you some great ideas for things to try or projects to take on.
