Whether it’s a painting, sculpture, or just a few lines on a canvas, an artist has the ability to transport us to another place and time.

Prioritization: How priorities should be set when brainstorming?
Creative ideas are always a great source of inspiration. However, when it comes to prioritizing them, there can be some tricky business. The best way to figure out what's most important is to brainstorm and come up with a few general options. Once you have that list, you can start filing those ideas away for later use or work on one of them first.

Trends in mobility: How will new transportation systems make it easier for people to connect and do their day-to-day tasks?
In the coming years, new transportation systems are going to make it easier for people to connect and do their day-to-day tasks. One of the most significant changes will be the growth of ride-sharing services. Ride-sharing platforms allow people to borrow a car from someone else, and then use it to drive around town or go to different places. This type of transportation system is becoming more popular every day, and it is just a matter of time until it becomes more widespread.
Another major change in the future will be the increasing popularity of bike lanes. Bike lanes are special pavement designs that help cyclists have more space to move around. These lanes are often built near busy intersections so that drivers can’t easily run into them.
