Approaches: How can you develop a big idea?
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that you can do to help develop them. One way is to think about what others have done or are planning to do and explore what possible combinations make sense. Additionally, it can be helpful to talk with people who have built something similar and see how they did it. Once you have a basic idea, itâ€™s important to get other people on board by telling them your idea and seeing if they will be interested in working on it. Finally, once all of these things are in place, you will need to put together a team andilialngs who are willing to work on the project.
