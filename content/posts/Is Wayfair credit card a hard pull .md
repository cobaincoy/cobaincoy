Hola, iam Amy Garcia, Buongiorno.
## Is Wayfair Credit Card A Hard Pull? [Solved]
Yes, the Wayfair Store Card will do a hard pull when you apply for it. This might negatively affect your credit score for a little while. You'll need at least fair credit to be considered eligible for this card. Fortunately, you can check if you pre-qualify without hurting your credit score.12 Aug 2021
