How do you come up with big ideas?
One of the best ways to come up with big ideas is by brainstorming. By thinking about possible solutions and possibilities, you can come up with concepts that may be even more interesting or challenging than what you currently think. Sometimes all it takes is some fresh creativity to inspire something new. So how do you go about brainstorming ideas? There are a few different methods, but the most important thing is to keep your ideas as accessible as possible so that everyone can contribute their own unique insights. Here are five ways: 
1) Take a walk around your neighborhood and see what local businesses are doing that could be applied to your city or town. This will give you a lot of potential inspirations for new ideas. 
2) Brainstorm with someone who knows more than you about a specific topic or problem.

The role of innovation in the future:
The role of innovation in the future is one that will be critical to the success of many businesses and organizations. Innovation can help increase efficiency and speed up the process of creating new products or services. It can also help companies improve their customer service experience and develop new marketing strategies.
However, even without innovation, businesses and organizations can still benefit from continued growth and success. Innovation allows businesses to experiment with new ways to do things, which can result in new ideas or products that are more efficient or effective than those that have been done before. This often leads to increased profits and sustainability for businesses.
