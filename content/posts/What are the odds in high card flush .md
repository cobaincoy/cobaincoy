## What Are The Odds In High Card Flush? [Solved]
Odds range from 7-to-1 to 8,000-to-1. The dealer and players each get seven cards. It's not like traditional poker, because four-of-a-kind and full-house hands don't matter. To win in this game, players need at least three cards of the same suit â€” a three-card flush.16 Feb 2014
