How did invention ideas come about?
Invention ideas come about when two people think of the same idea and come up with a plan to make it a reality. Invention ideas can come from anywhere, but often they start with an idea that someone has had before. Sometimes an idea is just too good to be true, but often the realisation that it could be used in a product or service makes it all the more appealing. For example, there was once a man who came up with the idea for a computer game called "Pac-Man". This game would help children learn about mathematics and science, something that was sorely lacking in their schools at the time. Another example is the invention of the telephone. Many people at first thought it couldn't be used because it was so big and expensive, but soon realised that it could be turned into a valuable tool for communication.

The power of creativity: How can it help you succeed?
Creativity is a powerful tool that can help you succeed in any field. By using creativity, you can come up with new ideas and strategies that can help you achieve your goals. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when using creativity as a tool: first, be realistic about what you want to achieve. Don't expect to create something overnight or from scratch; rather, use creativity as an engine to help you realize your goals. Additionally, be sure that your creative ideas are feasible and achievable. If they aren't, you may find it difficult to implement them into reality. Finally, don't forget the importance of practice! The more time you spend practicing your creative processes, the better equipped you will be for anything that comes your way – whether it's creating new ideas or finishing projects.
