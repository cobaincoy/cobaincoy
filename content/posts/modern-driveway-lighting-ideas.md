The future of inventions: What needs to be done in order for new inventions to thrive?
Inventions have always been a part of humanity’s history, but as the world has become more complex, so too has the need for new inventions. This is especially true in today’s world, where technology is constantly evolving and becoming more advanced. In order for new inventions to thrive, however, there are several key things that need to be done. 
One of the most important things that needs to be done is to make sure that new inventions are passed on from one generation to the next. This can be done by creating a system where people can share ideas for new inventions with each other, and then testing and dubbing them into products or services. It also helps to create a market for these products or services by attracting investors who can help to bring these products or services to market quickly.

How can we develop big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, anyone can have them. It's just a matter of coming up with a plan and executing it. Here are four tips that can help you get started:
1. Definition: What is your idea?

 defines your idea in the most concise way possible, which will give you more room to work on it without feeling overwhelmed. Once you've nailed down what your idea is, make sure that everyone who will need to hear it (including yourself) agrees on its importance. This will ensure that the idea has enough power to carry out its potential.

2. Execution: How are you going to execute your idea?

This is where things get tricky. If your plan isn't well- thought-out or if you don't have enough manpower or resources at your disposal, your idea won't be able to take off.
