Defining Innovation
Innovation is a term that is used frequently but often left undefined. This creates confusion when discussing innovation and can lead to misunderstanding its true meaning. When speaking about innovation, one must first define it in order to have a common understanding of the topic at hand.
Innovation is typically defined as introducing something new, whether it be an idea, method, or product. However, this definition does not capture the full scope of what innovation entails. Innovation often leads to change, which can be either incremental or radical. Incremental change is small and gradual, while radical change is more significant and happens suddenly. Both types of changes are essential for innovation to occur.

There are many factors that contribute to innovation. One important factor is a company’s culture.

What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating new and useful products or services. Innovation can be found in both traditional businesses and startups. A business that is constantly innovating will likely have a higher chance for success than one that is not as innovative. In order to be successful, a business must provide value to its customers and compete with other companies on a regular basis. A startup, on the other hand, does not have the same constraints as a traditional company and can often be more creative in their product development.
