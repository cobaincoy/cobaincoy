How do you know if your ideas are big enough?
Big ideas can be hard to come by, but they can be incredibly powerful. If you have a great idea for a new product or service, the first step is to find the right people to create it and market it. Once you've got your idea out there, it'll be up to you to see if it becomes a reality. If you're not sure if your idea is big enough, there are a few ways to determine whether or not it's possible to execute successfully. 
The first way is through market research. This process involves collecting data about what people want and how they feel about products or services. Once you've gathered this information, you can begin developing an idea for something that will appeal to all types of people.

What are some tips for making big ideas a reality?
There are a few things you can do to help turn big ideas into reality. Here are some tips:
1. Make sure your idea is unique and interesting. Don’t just copy other people’s ideas – make sure you have your own approach that will stand out from the rest.

2. Get input from others – get feedback from people who have experience in the industry you’re thinking of entering. This will help you develop your idea further and come up with moreQaeda-friendly ideas.

3. Be persistent – if you don’t keep trying, eventually someone will come up with an idea that is similar to yours but has a bit more money or prestige attached to it. Keep at it, and eventually your idea will be accepted and turned into a reality!
