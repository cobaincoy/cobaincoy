what is creativity?
What is creativity? It’s a question that has been asked throughout history, and one that still stumps us today. There are many definitions of creativity, but at its core, creativity is about generating new ideas.
It’s not just about coming up with crazy, out-of-the-box ideas (although that can be part of it). Creativity can also be about finding new ways to solve problems or approaching tasks in a different way.

So why is creativity important? For one, it’s essential for innovation. Without creativity, we wouldn’t have any new products, technologies or ideas. And in a world that’s constantly changing and evolving, we need to be able to adapt and come up with new solutions to keep up.

Creativity is also important for our mental health.

The Origins of Creativity: How did creativity develop?
Creativity is often thought of as a natural ability that is innate in some people. However, the origins of creativity may be more complex than that. There are multiple theories about how creativity developed, and it's still an open question for scientists and philosophers alike. One theory suggests that creativity may have arisen from the need to solve problems. Another theory suggests that creativity may come from the need to find new ways to do things. There are many possible explanations for why creativity exists, and it'll continue to be a mystery until further research is done.
