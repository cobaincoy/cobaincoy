5. External Review and recommendation: How do you get feedback from others about your idea?
When you're developing a new idea, it's important to get feedback from others who can provide valuable insights. But how do you get feedback from those who are not your direct contemporaries or even friends? There are a few ways to get feedback, but the most effective way is through an external review and recommendation. External reviews can help assess whether your idea is worth pursuing and, if so, whether there are any potential roadblocks that need to be addressed.

Conclusion
Innovation has the ability to create new value for businesses and organizations, but it must be managed carefully in order to be successful. The process of innovation involves four distinct stages: ideation, development, commercialization, and scaling. Each stage presents its own challenges and opportunities, but the rewards can be great if innovation is managed effectively.
Organizations that innovate successfully tend to have a few key attributes in common. They are open to new ideas, willing to take risks, and have a culture that supports creativity and experimentation. They also have a clear understanding of their customers’ needs and how they can be met in new ways.

 Innovation is essential for businesses to thrive in today’s ever-changing marketplace. But it’s not enough to simply have good ideas – they must be executed well in order to create lasting value.

The different types of creative art
There are many different types of creative art. Some people may think of art as paintings in a museum, while others may think of it as the music they listen to on the radio. Creative art can be anything that someone creates that is intended to be beautiful or expressive. Here are some of the different types of creative art:
Painting: Painting is one of the most popular forms of creative art. People have been painting for centuries, and there are many different styles and techniques that can be used. If you're interested in painting, you can learn about different brushstrokes and color theory to create beautiful works of art.

Sculpture: Sculpture is another popular form of creative art. Unlike painting, sculpture is three-dimensional, so it can be touched and interacted with.

Trends in social media: How will people communicate and share their ideas?
New trends in social media continue to emerge, and many people are exploring the various platforms to share their ideas. These days, it's not difficult to find a message or idea that can be shared on social media. However, there are some key considerations that should be made when creating content for social media. 
One of the most important things to remember when sharing content on social media is to keep it concise and to the point. Many people are used to reading long paragraphs or posts, so it's important that the author is clear and concise in what they're saying. Additionally, it's important to make sure that all of your content is original and not copied from other sources. If you want your content to stand out from the rest, you need to create something new and unique.
