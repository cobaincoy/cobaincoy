The downside of having invention ideas: They take time and effort
Invention ideas are a dime a dozen. But turning an invention idea into a reality takes time, money and effort.
Many would-be inventors never take the first step because they don't know where to start or they are afraid of failure.

There is no guarantee that your invention will be a success. In fact, most inventions never make it to market. Even if your invention is successful, you may not see any financial return on your investment for years, if at all.

state the purpose of the blog article
1. A blog is a platform where people can share their ideas and views on various topics. It is a way of expressing oneself and connecting with like-minded people.
2. A good blog article should have a purpose, whether it is to inform, entertain or inspire the reader. Without a purpose, the article will be aimless and directionless.

3. The best way to choose a purpose for your article is to consider what you want the reader to take away from it. What do you want them to think or feel after reading it? Once you have decided on the purpose of your article, everything else will fall into place.

Definition of Innovation: How does it differ from other types of innovation?
Innovation is the process of change in a product or service. It can be defined as a new way of doing something, or an alteration in the way that something is done. Innovation can come from people or businesses, and it can happen in a number of different ways. 
One common definition of innovation is "the use of new ideas, methods and approaches to solve problems." This definition includes many different aspects to innovation, including business models, product design, marketing strategy and even customer service. It's important to note that innovation doesn't have to happen only in the context of business; it can also occur within individual teams or startups. 

The most distinguishing feature of innovation is its impact on society. Innovation can mean different things for different industries, but one thing that's always included is the idea of creating value for others.
