Filming: How do you film your creative ideas?
Filming Creative Ideas can be a pretty enlightening experience, if done correctly. Not only do you get to see your ideas in action, but you also get to learn how to capture and film creative moments that will help you grow as a filmmaker. Here are four tips to filming creative ideas: 1. Do your research: before you start shooting, it’s important to do your research on what type of footage is going to work best for your story. What does the audience want? What are the challenges of capturing that vision successfully? These questions will help determine the filming techniques that work best for your project. 2. Get creative: not all creativity is created equal. Sometimes, filming creative ideas can be more about experimenting than taking risks.
