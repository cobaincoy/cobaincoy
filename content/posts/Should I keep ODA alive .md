## Should I Keep Oda Alive? [Solved]
 Cyberpunk 2077 - Kill Or Spare Oda? There's basically no benefit to finishing Oda off in this fight. He won't come after you if you spare him and you don't get anything special for ending his life. However, if you decide to spare Oda, he could turn up in one of the game's optional finales.14 Dec 2020
