## Is Wtf A Swear? [Solved]
WTF is a profane slang expression that teenagers use to express exasperation, irritation, or incredulity. The abbreviation is considered less offensive than saying the actual words that it stands for. Another way to express the thought in a manner that is milder is to use the military code, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.
