## Is There A Dress Code To Play Golf? [Solved]
 In general, a collared shirt and Dockers-style shorts or slacks will get you onto most golf courses (additionally, golf skirts or skorts for women). Many lower-priced courses also permit denim shorts or blue jeans. But most upscale courses require collared shirts and have a no-denim rule.24 May 2019
