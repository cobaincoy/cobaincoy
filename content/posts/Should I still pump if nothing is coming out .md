## Should I Still Pump If Nothing Is Coming Out? [Solved]
Increasing your milk supply will take time, so don't give up. Even dry pumps (when you pump but nothing comes out) sends a signal to your body that more milk is needed on tap, so it's getting the work done even if there's no output to show for it right away. Stick with it and you'll see the results after a few days.30 Jul 2021
