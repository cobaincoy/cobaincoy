CreativeWork: What makes a good creative idea?
Creative ideas are not only great for businesses, but also for individuals. Whether you’re a creative artist or just want to come up with new ideas, creativity is essential. There are certain things that make good creative ideas, and these are often based on your own experience or what you’ve learned. Here are some things to consider when coming up with your next idea: 
1) What is your target audience? When you come up with an idea, be sure to think about what kind of message or product you’d like to reach out to. Is it just for yourself, or do you have an audience in mind? 
2) What can you realistically accomplish? Are there any challenges that you can overcome using your creativity? If so, make sure they’re still worth considering.

Conclusion: The importance of invention
Invention is extremely important because it allows humans to solve problems and improve their quality of life. Inventions can be small, like the wheel or the pencil, or they can be large, like the telephone or the internet. Whatever their size, inventions are always important because they make our lives better.
Without invention, we would still be living in caves and eating raw meat. We would not have fire or clothes or shelter. We would not have any of the comforts that we take for granted today. Invention is what makes us human and it is what separates us from the animals.

Invention is also important because it drives economic growth. Every new invention creates new jobs and new industries. It is invention that has made America the richest country in the world. And it is invention that will continue to make America great in the future.
