What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas are a huge part of any person’s life. Whether you’re an artist, writer, musician, or simply thinking outside the box, creativity is a huge part of who you are. Here are some creative ideas to get you started:
1. Create your own designs or tattoos. This can be a great way to show your creative side and see what people think of your work.

2. Draw on your own experiences or those around you for inspiration. This can be something as simple as taking a walk in nature and drawing what you see, or writing down what you learn about someone else in their life.

3. Listen to music and watch movies for inspiration. Not only will this give you ideas for new tattoos or designs, but it will also help with planning future events or projects.

History of invention: How has innovation been used throughout history?
Invention has been a key part of human history for as long as humans have been able to create something. This includes both the simple things like making tools or buildings, and more complex items like air travel or computers. Inventions have had a direct impact on the way we live and work, as well as the way society functions. 
Here are three examples of some of the most famous inventions in human history: 

1) The printing press was invented by Johannes Gutenberg in 1455, which allowed for the spread of literacy and knowledge across cultures. 
2) The Concorde class jet airliner was developed by British Airways in 1969, which made air travel much more affordable and practical.
