The three main types of innovation: Inventive method, product, and service.
Innovation is the process of creating new products, services, or methods that are different from those currently in use. Innovation can be found in many places, but three main areas are technology, business, and product innovation. 
Product innovation is the development of new products that solve problems or improve upon existing products. Business innovation is the creation of new ways to do things that are not commonly done. And finally, service innovation is the development of new ways to provide goods and services to customers.

Conclusion: How can we address the big ideas and challenges in our society?
In recent decades, there has been a growing interest in big ideas and challenges in our society. This trend began to take root in the 1970s with the work of Murray Bookchin, and has continued to grow in recent years as more people have become interested in concepts such as human emancipation, sustainability, and democracy.
There are a number of big ideas that need to be addressed if we want to see a flourishing society that is both sustainable and emancipatory. Here are three examples:

1) We need a new understanding of what it means to be human. We currently operate within a systems-based view of being human, which values materialism over spiritual development. This perspective creates obstacles for humans as they try to find their place within the world.

2) We need a new understanding of how social movements can work together.
