1) national Geographic Hexagon Sleeping Bag - This bag is perfect if you're looking for a comfortable and spacious tent. It has an interior profile that makes it easy to find a place to sleep while on your trip. Plus, it comes in black or green!

2) Osprey Tents - These tents are perfect if you're looking for a heavyweight tent that can withstand any weather conditions. They come in both children's and adult sizes and have plenty of hanging space inside.
