## Is Tp Known As Pressure Potential? [Solved]
TP or turgor pressure can be defined as a force inside the cell that helps to push the plasma membrane against the cell wall. It is also called hydrostatic pressure. Suction pressure or SP is the difference between OP and TP. Note: In a fully turgid cell, turgor pressure is equal to osmotic pressure.
