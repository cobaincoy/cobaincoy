## Is There Romance In Far Cry 6? [Solved]
Far Cry 6 does not offer romance options. A romantic relationship can neither be conceived in a female nor a male voice, though you might find something to interest Dani based on the gender you select. The building of any relationships in the game can only take place with the blessing of a leader in an unstable nation.5 Apr 2022
