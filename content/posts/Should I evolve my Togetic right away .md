Hola, iam Ignacio Mini, Have an A+ day.
## Should I Evolve My Togetic Right Away? [Solved]
You can find a Shiny Stone in the end room of the mine at Iron Island. I would also recommend evolving both Togepi and Togetic as fast as possible unless there is a move you'd like to get from when Togetic levels up as Togekiss can learn no moves by leveling.6 Jul 2017
