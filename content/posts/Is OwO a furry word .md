## Is Owo A Furry Word? [Solved]
 OwO, also stylized as owo, as a furry term, is a chat emoticon and meme used in furry text-based conversation and roleplay, normally with a sexual connotation, sometimes as a trolling term. The two Os represent wide and open eyes, and the w represents a cutesy anime-styled mouth.15 Oct 2021
