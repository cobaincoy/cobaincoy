Patent applications are the single most common type of document filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). They account for about 60% of all patent filings, and they are also the most popular type of application.

 Utility patents are the most common type of patent application, and they're used to protect ideas that have no practical use yet but could be very beneficial in the future. For example, a company might file a utility patent for a new product that can help cut energy costs.

Design patents protect specific features or designs of products.
