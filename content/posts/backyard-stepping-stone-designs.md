Invention of the World Wide Web
In 1839, Nicholas-Jacques Conte wrote a paper on the idea of a world wide web, which would eventually be called the Internet. The first real steps were made in 1947 when Claude Shannon and others developed the theory of information theory, which allowed for the Transmission of Information over Communications Channels. The following year, IBM created an electronic computer called Punchy, which was used to test communication protocols on. In 1951, Xerox PARC developed the Alto computer system that could be connected to a network. On August 29th of that year, US president Harry Truman announced his plan to create the American National Telecommunications Commission (ANTC), which would control all federal telecommunications regulations. This was the beginning of what is now known as the Internet era.

Definition of innovation:
Innovation is the process of creating new and better ways to do things. It can be found in everything from designing a product to marketing a company. In today's economy, innovation is key to keeping businesses afloat and ensuring their success.
There are many definitions of innovation, but one that has been shown to be most effective is the "eight-legged stool" definition created by Michael Porter. This definition states that innovation consists of creating new products or services that are different from those currently on the market, as well as making them more affordable and user-friendly.

The term "innovation" can be used in a number of ways for businesses, including marketing, product development, and even company culture. It's important for businesses to understand what type of innovation they need in order to grow and succeed over the long term.
