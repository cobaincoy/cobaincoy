Technology transfer: How does technology be transferred from one company to another?
Invention Ideas: 
-One way to move technology between companies is to have a technology transfer agent (TTA) act as a middleman. The TTA helps negotiate and execute the transfer of technology, ensuring that both companies share the benefits of the invention. 
-Another way to move technology between companies is through joint development. If one company has a good idea for a new product, they may want to share it with other companies in order to get ideas for products and services. This way, both companies are able to gain experience with the product before anything is actually created. 
-Finally, there is also the option of transferring technology over the internet. This method allows for quick and easy transfers of technology so that both companies can benefit from each other's inventions.

The power of creative ideas: How can they help your business or organization achieve success?
Creative ideas can help your business or organization achieve success in a variety of ways. By using creative ideas, you can increase the chances of success and create a more positive working environment. Here are six tips to help you find creative ideas that may be beneficial for your business or organization:
1. Allow yourself time to brainstorm. When you have an idea for a product or service, don’t immediately start creating prototypes. Give yourself time to think about it and come up with different options. This will help you get a better understanding of what the product or service can be and how it could be improved.

2. Talk to other businesses. Not all businesses are the same, so talking to other businesses will give you a better idea of what they’re doing and how they’ve been successful with their products or services.
