Here are four tips for coming up with creative ideas: 
1. Don’t force yourself to come up with ideas; let your mind wander. There are no right or wrong answers, just some helpful things to keep in mind when brainstorming: What do you want? What does this have potential to achieve? What would make this an interesting and useful addition to your product or service? How can you make it more efficiently or effectively?

The Invention of the Electric Shock guitar
Electric shock guitars were invented in the late 1800s by George Lukacs, a musician and inventor. Lukacs had been playing an electric guitar that used alternating current (A.C.) to create sound, and he realized that electric guitars could be used for amplification. In 1892, Lukacs developed his first model electric guitar, the Electric Guitar Company's "Lukacs Guitars." The guitar was designed to be affordable and easy to play, with a single-coil pickup and a simple design. In 1934, Lukacs died at the age of 83, but his electric guitar remains one of the most significant instruments in history.
