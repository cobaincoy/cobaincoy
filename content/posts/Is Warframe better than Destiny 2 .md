## Is Warframe Better Than Destiny 2? [Solved]
While Warframe does offer a much better experience for solo players, grinding content by yourself can get quite mind-numbing without friends around to make it interesting. Destiny 2 feels almost unplayable without friends and having a full Strike Team makes the game much easier than playing solo.15 Jun 2022
