Hi, iam Brandon Whitney, I bid you good day, sir/ma’am.
## Should You Open Windows When It'S Hot Outside? [Solved]
No, generally you should not open windows in summer if it is hotter outside than inside. You should also keep curtains and blinds closed, to further keep out the heat. As with opening your windows, the best time to let any light in during the day is in the morning, before the temperature rises too much.18 Jul 2022
