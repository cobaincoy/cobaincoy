## Is Ward Cameron A Psychopath? [Solved]
 Initially, Ward seems like a nice, stand-up guy in the beginning of Season 1, but is eventually revealed as a psychopath, manipulator and killer. He is very protective of his daughter, Sarah, but does not seem to care about his other kids, Rafe and Wheezie.
