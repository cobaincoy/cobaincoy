How can we find big ideas?
Ideas are everything that makes life interesting. They can help us solve problems, make new friends, or just have some fun. But finding big ideas can be tough. You need to think outside the box and come up with something that nobody else has thought of before. But how do you do it? There are a few techniques that can help you find big ideas. 
One technique is to brainstorm. brainstorming is when you come up with ideas by taking whatever comes into your head and making it a sentence or two long. This will help you think of as many different ideas as possible and make sure that you don’t get too stuck on one idea. 

Another technique is to come up with multiple concepts. Concepts are the building blocks of big ideas, and they help you figure out what kind of idea could be turned into a business or product.
