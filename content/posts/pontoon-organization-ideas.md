How creativity impacts our lives
Creativity is a key factor that impacts our lives in many ways. Some say itâ€™s the spark of inspiration that gets us going, while others say creativity comes from the willingness to take chances and work hard. Whatever the case may be, creativity has an impact on our lives in some way. 
For example, if you have a creative idea for a new product, you may be more likely to produce it if you are inspired by the prospect of making something new and different.
