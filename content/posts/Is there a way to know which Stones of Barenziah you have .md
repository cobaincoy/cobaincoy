## Is There A Way To Know Which Stones Of Barenziah You Have? [Solved]
No, there is no "ingame" way. You can do a quick research for them on the web tho,and find the location yourself. Keep in mind that, there are stones that you may only have one chance to get, maybe during a quest or an event, so if you miss it, you won't be able to take all the 24 stones.5 Apr 2012
