Overcoming creative blocks: what to do when you can't think of anything
When you feel like you can't think of anything, it can be frustrating. But there are ways to overcome creative blocks. Here are a few ideas: 
1. Take a break: Sometimes when you feel like you can't think of anything, it's because you've been thinking too hard. Step away from your work and take a break. Go for a walk, watch a movie, or read a book. Once you take your mind off of your project, you may find that the ideas start flowing again.

2. Talk to someone: When you're feeling stuck, talking to someone else can give you some fresh perspective. Brainstorm with a friend or colleague. They may have some ideas that you hadn't thought of before.

Trends in economy: What will be the biggest changes to the economy in 2022?
In 2022, the economy is expected to undergo a number of significant changes. These changes could lead to significant shifts in the way business is conducted and the way workers are employed. Some of the biggest changes that are expected to take place in the economy include: 
-The rise in automation technology will create new opportunities for businesses and workers alike. With machines able to do more than ever before, businesses can save money by using fewer employees and instead employ robots. 

- technological advances will also help increase productivity within businesses. By making it easier for businesses to track data and analyze it, companies can better understand what is working well and what needs improvement. This information can then be used to improve products or services. 

- Economic growth will continue apace, but there may be some minor setbacks as a result of global economic uncertainty.
