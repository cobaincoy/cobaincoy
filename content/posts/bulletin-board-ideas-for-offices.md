Outcomes of Creative Ideas: What happens when you use creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be really helpful in terms of solving problems or improving the quality of a product or service. However, they can also have negative outcomes if not used correctly. Here are five tips to get the most out of creative ideas:
1. Make sure your ideas are sound. It’s impossible to come up with great ideas without some form of understanding what you’re trying to achieve. Make sure your concepts are clear, executable, and likely to work in practice.

2. Take a step back first. While it may be tempting to take things one step further and come up with something truly unique, doing so could actually backfire if it doesn’t have a real bearing on the problem at hand.

How can people start thinking about new ideas?
Most people think of ideas when they are brainstorming, but there are other ways to come up with new ideas. Sometimes all you need is a new perspective. Here are three tips to help you get started: 
1. Give yourself time: Sometimes the best way to come up with new ideas is to allow yourself time to think about them. Don’t try to come up with any ideas in an instant. Take your time and consider everything that you have said before coming up with a new idea. 

2. Be open-minded: Once you have considered some potential ideas, it’s important that you be open-minded about them. If something doesn’t sound right or feels too farfetched, don’t be afraid to change your mind after thinking about it more. Remember that every idea has at least one potential application.
