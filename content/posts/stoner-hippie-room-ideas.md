The Process of Invention: How ideas are born and developed
Invention is the process by which new ideas are born and developed. It starts with a brainstorming session, where people come up with ideas for products or services. Next, the team that will be working on developing these ideas must come up with a plan for how to make this idea a reality. This includes coming up with a concept, creating drawings, and finally making prototypes. Once these prototypes have been created, it is then important to test them to see if they are effective. If not, then the team must go back and revise their plan until they are successful.

How to come up with great big ideas
Big ideas can be a really fun way to get your creative juices flowing. Here are some tips on how to come up with great big ideas. 
1. Get organized: When you have a lot of ideas, it can be hard to decide which ones to work on. One way to make this process easier is to create a list of main points or topics that you want to cover. From there, you can break each one down into smaller pieces and start working on those that seem the most interesting and important. 

2. Be open to change: It’s rare that something will stay the same for very long in life. Sometimes what seemed like an easy idea at first might not be as difficult as we thought it would be after further thought. This is where being open to change comes in handy.
