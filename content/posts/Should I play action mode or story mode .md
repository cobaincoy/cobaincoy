Hi, iam Theodore Halford, Don’t work too hard.
## Should I Play Action Mode Or Story Mode? [Solved]
The first is Action Mode. This is the recommended setting for most players, particularly those who are familiar with Far Cry games and other FPS games similar to it. You'll take a lot of damage from enemies, and will need to heal more often. Story Mode, on the other hand, prioritises story over the action.7 Oct 2021
