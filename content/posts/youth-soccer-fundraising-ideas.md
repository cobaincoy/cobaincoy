The Benefits of Big Ideas: Why should we be thinking about big ideas?
Big ideas are the stuff of dreams and innovation. They can be anything from simple, like a new product or service, to groundbreaking, like a new way of thinking about life. And they can be big enough to bring about real change – or simply be interesting enough to inspire others to come up with their own big ideas.
The benefits of big ideas are clear: they drive innovation and creativity, help businesses expand their reach and reach new markets, increase productivity and efficiency, and even improve communication and teamwork. But there are also some key reasons why we should think about big ideas more often – and research has shown that the rewards can be great indeed.

In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on the importance of creativity – both in business circles and as a whole.
