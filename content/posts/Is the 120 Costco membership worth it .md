## Is The $120 Costco Membership Worth It? [Solved]
We'll make it very clear and simple for you: the $120 annual fee for the Executive card is worth it if you spend more than $500 a month or $6,000 a year total at Costco on eligible purchases. Those are the exact numbers needed to get $120 in rewards and break even on the extra yearly cost in the membership fees.
