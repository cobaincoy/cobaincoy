Conclusion: How to develop big ideas effectively.
Big ideas are the seeds that can turn a small idea into a big project or idea. They are the building blocks of success in any creative endeavor. By understanding how to develop big ideas effectively, you can make your projects more likely to succeed. 
To landscape a new garden, for example, it is important to understand the different types of plants and what they will grow in. To develop a plan for an office remodel, employees need to understand the different needs of each room and how best to layout them so that everyone has their space. 

 Big ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: making your project more likely to succeed. With practice, you can develop the ability to identify and capitalize on these opportunities.

The evaluation of ideas
Evaluating ideas is important in order to determine which are worth pursuing and which are not. There are a few key factors to consider when evaluating an idea:
- How original is the idea? If it's been done before, is it being done in a new or different way?
- Is the idea feasible? Can it be realistically implemented?
- What is the potential impact of the idea? Will it make a difference?
- How much support does the idea have? Are there people who believe in it and will help to make it happen?

What is invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, product, or service that was not previously thought of. Inventions can come in many forms, from small ideas to huge leaps in technology.

But no matter what form an invention takes, it is an essential part of our society and economy.

Definition of big ideas: What are they and how do they differ from small ideas?
Big ideas are ideas that have the potential to change the world. They can be HUGE or they can be very small. The important thing is that they are big enough to warrant a serious thought and consideration. Small ideas, on the other hand, are just ideas.
