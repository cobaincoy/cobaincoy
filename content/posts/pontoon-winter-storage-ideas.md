What are some easy and effective ways to improve your home’s energy efficiency?
There are many easy and effective ways to improve your home's energy efficiency, but it depends on your needs and what you're targeting. Here are a few tips:
1. Improve insulation - An improved insulation will help reduce your home's energy bill by reducing the amount of heat that comes in and out. Start by making sure all of your walls and ceilings are installed with at least 1/2 inch of R-Value. This will help avoid excess heat from coming in, as well as save money on your heating bill in the long run.

2. Add window air conditioners - If you havewindows that open into small spaces or if the windows don't have fans, adding window air conditioners can save you a lot of money in the long run.
