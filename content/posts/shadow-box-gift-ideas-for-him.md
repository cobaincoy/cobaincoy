Conclusion: What are some ideas for inventions?
Ideas for inventions can come in many forms. Sometimes, an invention is a new way of doing something, like the wheel. Other times, an inventor may come up with a new product, like the iPhone. Whatever the form, there are certain things that must be included in order to make an invention work. These things include creativity, innovation, and feasibility. 
Creativity is important when it comes to Invention ideas. For example, think about how you could come up with a new way to market a product or sell a service.

Invention and Technology- What is the difference?
There is a big difference between invention and technology. Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, while technology is the use of that idea to make something happen. Invention can be anything from a simple solution to a complex product or service. Shelly Korman, an inventor and business owner, said that invention is the “f initest and simplest form of creativity.” It can be something as simple as coming up with an idea for a product or service, or coming up with a way to do something better than what someone else has done before. Technology, on the other hand, can be anything from making something work better than it ever has before to creating artificial intelligence (AI). There are so many different ways that technology can be used, and there is no one right way to use them all.
