## Should I Defuse Or Confront Viper? [Solved]
If you pick the confronting ones it will result in a duel against the Viper, but you cannot kill him (the duel ends when his health is low). If you pick the defusing ones, it will skip the duel and instead you talk it out. Either way, you always get the same next objective.19 Aug 2021
