## Is Ticket Transfer On Ticketmaster Safe? [Solved]
Yes, it's safe. When you transfer a ticket, the person you are sending the tickets to must accept the tickets in our secure marketplace. When they accept their ticket, we issue a new barcode to them. This keeps you protected and they get secure tickets they can trust.
