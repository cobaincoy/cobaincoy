Hello, iam Keith Archer, Have a good day!
## Should I Wash Crochet Blanket Before Gifting? [Solved]
If I'm gifting an item that is wearable, or will touch the skin in any way, I always launder the item prior to gifting it. If it's something that will be used in the process of washing (a dishcloth), or an item that will be used to display in the home (a coaster, basket, or wall art) I never wash before gifting.
