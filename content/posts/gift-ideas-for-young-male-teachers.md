The science of creativity
A person's creativity is often thought of as a mysterious quality that cannot be measured or studied. However, there is a growing body of research that suggests otherwise. The science of creativity is an interdisciplinary field that examines the nature and development of creative abilities.
While there is no single definition of creativity, it is generally defined as the ability to produce new and innovative ideas. Creativity is often seen as a rare or elusive quality, but recent research suggests that it is more common than previously thought.

There are many different factors that contribute to creativity. Some of these include intelligence, genes, environment, and motivation. However, one of the most important aspects of creativity is divergent thinking. This is the ability to come up with multiple solutions to a problem or multiple ways to approach a task.

Why big ideas?
In business, big ideas are important to succeed. They can help businesses capitalize on new opportunities and strategies, or give them a leg up in the competition. Here are four reasons why big ideas can be so beneficial: 
1) Big ideas can inspire creativity and innovation. When you have a great idea that others can see as something new and interesting, it can lead to more creative thinking and better ideas overall. 
2) They can be easier to execute than smaller projects. When you have a well-thought-out plan with specific goals in mind, it’s much easier to get things moving quickly and get your project completed on time. This means that your organization won’t have to waste timeWaiting for someone else to come up with an innovative solution or taking too long to develop a plan that’s actually achievable.
