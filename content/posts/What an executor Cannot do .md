## What An Executor Cannot Do? [Solved]
An executor must be impartial. Neither he/she, nor his/her family, friends, may benefit unfairly (for example from the sale of an asset). He/She must carry out the instructions in the will, as well as reasonable instructions of the heirs. Quarrels with heirs should not interfere with his or her duties.
