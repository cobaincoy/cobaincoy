Invention stories: How some inventions were born and others were created
Invention stories are a common occurrence in history. Many inventions were born from the intersection of two or more different ideas and concepts. One invention might be a new way to do something, while another might be a more efficient way to do something. 
One example of an invention that was created from multiple ideas is the computer. Originally, computers were thought to be simple devices that could only do basic tasks like read and write.
