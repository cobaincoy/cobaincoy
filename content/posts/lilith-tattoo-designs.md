Types of creativity: Realistic, abstract, etc.
Creativity is a difficult thing to define. Some people might say that creativity is ideas that come out of the blue, while others might say that creativity is being able to come up with new and exciting ways to do something. To some, it may be easy to see how creativity can be used in art, while others might not have a specific definition for what creative art really is. However, regardless of what someone believes or how they define it, there are definitely types of creativity that are more realistic than abstract and more realistic than creative art.

How to develop them: Be creative
Invention ideas don't just come to people in a sudden eureka moment; usually, it's the result of a process of development. If you want to learn how to develop your own invention ideas, there are a few things you can do. 
First, take some time to brainstorm and think about the problems you encounter in your daily life. What would make your life easier? What does not work well or efficiently? Once you have identified some potential areas for improvement, do some research to see if anyone else has had the same idea. 

Next, start thinking about possible solutions to the problem. How could it be fixed? What would be the best way to achieve this? Try to come up with several different ideas, and then evaluate each one. Which one is most feasible? Which one would be the most effective?
