Conclusion: Why should we care about invention?
Invention is the creative process of coming up with a new idea or design. It can be anything from a new product to a new way of doing something. The invention of the printing press was an incredible event in human history, and it is also responsible for many medical advances. There are countless other examples that can be provided, but the point is that invention is important.
There are several reasons why innovation should be taken seriously. First, innovation allows companies and countries to come up with new products and technologies faster than they would otherwise be able to. Second, it helps businesses make money by creating new ideas and products that people will want to buy. Third, innovation can help scientists learn more about how the world works and how to better understand problems. Finally, innovation can help society function more efficiently – for example, by developing new ways of warfare or managing social networks.

Conclusion
When it comes to brainstorming, there are a few things you need to keep in mind. First, don’t worry about coming up with the “right” answer. There is no such thing when you’re brainstorming. The whole point is to come up with as many ideas as possible, even if they’re not all good. Second, allow yourself to think outside the box. The best ideas often come from thinking in a way that you wouldn’t normally. And finally, don’t be afraid to ask for help. Brainstorming with someone else can give you some great new perspectives on an issue.
