What makes a good idea?
Every idea has a differentiator and what makes a good one is always subjective. Some people might find the concept interesting, others might not. There are many factors to consider when choosing an idea, such as how well it will be executed, who will be using it, and whether it is something that users are already passionate about. 
One of the most important things to consider when coming up with ideas is whether or not they are big enough to warrant investment. If an idea is too small or unimportant to warrant attention, it will likely be forgotten or passed over. A good example of this was the iPhone app Gap which was only released in Australia but contained massive potential because users were already interested in fashion and had tonnes of feedback. Another example would be Square which was originally considered a payment platform but has since become a popular social media platform for businesses and individuals.

The Benefits of New Ideas: What do they offer?
The benefits of new ideas are vast and range from more efficient ways to do things to new and innovative products that can change the way people live. Here are a few examples: 
1. New ideas can help you save time and money. If you can think of a way to make your work or home easier, you may be able to save time and money on tasks that you previously would have had to spend hours completing. 
2. New ideas can improve your creativity. When you come up with new ideas, it can be difficult not to come up with something that is both good and useful. By taking some time for yourself to come up with new ideas, you will be more likely to find something onerous or simply useless as well as something valuable that you could implement into your life immediately. 
3. New ideas can make life easier.
