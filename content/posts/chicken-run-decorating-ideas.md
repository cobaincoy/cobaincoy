Ideas: What are they?
Everyone has their own ideas, whether they are creative or not. Ideas can be anything from a new recipe to a way to solve a problem. They can also be justifications for what someone has done in the past, or ways to make something better. 
Ideas can be incredibly helpful when it comes to creating things or solving problems. However, they can also backfire if not properly considered. For example, if an idea is something that an individual has never done before, but is based on their own personal experience or insights, it may be more likely to succeed than if it is something that was originated by someone else. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that ideas should not be taken too seriously; rather, they should be used as a tool for exploring and growth rather than as the only source of information.

Conclusion: What is creativity and what can it do for us?
Creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, concepts, or solutions to problems. It can be used for good or bad. The good side of creativity is that it can help us come up with new ideas, solutions, and ways to improve our lives. The bad side of creativity is that it can cause us to be creative and think outside the box, but also can lead us astray from the paths we were meant to take. Despite these risks, creativity is something that should be cherished and appreciated.

That’s why it’s essential to be sure your idea is worth taking on. There are a few key principles that help make an idea a good one: It should be something people want or need; it should be novel and have potential to change the world; it should have a commercial Potential; and it should be feasible to execute. Here are three examples of ideas that researchers at Imperial College London say might just be worth pursuing: 
1. A contact lens that records what you see When contact lenses become more prevalent, many people will likely want to know what they’re looking at. This could lead to new ways for seeing the world and improving safety for everyone involved.
