What are some of the new ideas out there and why should you be interested in them?
Some of the newer ideas out there could potentially change how you live, work and play. Some of them are even easier to implement than others, so it’s important that you decide whether or not they’re right for you. Here are three examples: 
1) Virtual Reality – This technology has the potential to completely change the way we interact with the world around us. By becoming a part of a virtual reality experience, you could learn new skills or explore different places without ever having to leave your home. 
2) Augmented Reality (AR) – This technology allows you to use tools and objects in your environment to create dynamic simulations. By using AR, you could become better at analyzing data or solving problems.

Patent applications: What are the most popular patent applications?
Patent applications are one of the most popular types of patent filings. They are used to protect ideas and inventions that may not be protected by other types of patents, like trade secret protection. 
 There are many different types of patent applications, but the most popular ones include: 
-Patent application for a new product 
-Patent application for a process or structure 
-Patent application for an invention 
There is no set number of patent applications that are filed in any given year, but it is generally safe to assume that there will be at least one type of patent application filed every month. This makes Patents a very important part of any development team as they can protect ideas and inventions from being ripped off by others.
