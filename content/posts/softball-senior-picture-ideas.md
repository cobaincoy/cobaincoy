How Invention ranges from ancient to modern
Invention has been around for centuries, with some of the earliest examples dating back to ancient Greece. Inventions that have shaped the modern world include the telephone, car, and air conditioning – all of which were created in the 19th century. However, some inventions are much older than that and predate even humanity. For example, the wheel was first invented by a man named Pangloss in 4500 BC.

Introduce the topic of inventions.
Invention ideas are everywhere, and it can be hard to know where to start. Here are a few tips on how to come up with invention ideas that could make your life easier.
Start by looking at the problems you face in your everyday life. What are some things that you wish were different or that you wish you had? These problem areas could be potential starting points for your invention idea.

You can also look to other people for inspiration. Talk to friends and family members about the things they find frustrating or difficult in their daily lives. See if they have any suggestions for improvements that could make their lives easier.

Once you have a general idea of what you want to invent, it’s time to start doing some research. See if there are already products on the market that address the problem you’re trying to solve.
