## Should You Wet Your Eyeshadow Brush? [Solved]
 Lightly mist the brush. You can use distilled or filtered water, makeup setting spray, or a makeup mixing medium. Avoid using tap water, as it tends to contain harmful bacteria. Also, do not dip the brush into the water, and don't get the eyeshadow itself wet. You want the brush to be damp, not soaking wet.
