Conclusion: How to come up with big ideas and what they mean for your business or project.
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that always apply: think outside the box, brainstorm, and be flexible. With that in mind, here are five tips on how to come up with big ideas for your business or project: 
1. Start by thinking about what you want your business or project to achieve. What problems do you want to solve? What goals do you want to achieve? This will give you a good starting point for brainstorming ideas. 
2. Be open to other suggestions. When you’re brainstorming, don’t be afraid to take other people’s suggestions into account. If someone has an idea that sounds great but doesn’t quite fit your project, don’t be afraid to change it up a bit – after all, this is brainstorming!

How can we use our time off work to improve our productivity?
Everyone has different work habits, and it can be difficult to stick to a specific schedule when taking time off for vacation. If you want to improve your productivity, there are a few ideas to consider. Here are three tips that can help you achieve better results: 
1. Make a list of the tasks that need to be completed in order for you to meet your goal. This will help you plan out what needs to be done and make sure that it is within your available time frame. 
2. Use technology tools such as calendars or email reminder systems to keep track of when you have free time. This will allow you to set aside specific times each week and not let work take over completely. 
3. Try out different methods of communication with co-workers in order to get them on the same page about how they can improve their productivity too.
