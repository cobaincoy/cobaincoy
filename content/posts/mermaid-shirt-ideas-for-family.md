brainstorming: What are some creative ways to come up with ideas?
Creative ideas are the lifeblood of any business. Whether it's coming up with new ways to market your company or coming up with new products or services, creativity is key. Here are a few creative ideas to get you started: 
1. unconscious brainstorming - This technique is when you come up with ideas without knowing why or how they'll help your business. Just think about what could work and then start thinking about ways to make it a reality. This can be fun because it can result in something that you never thought possible. 
2. using prototypes - A prototype is a version of an idea that's been created specifically for testing and feedback purposes. It can help you explore different aspects of your product before finally committed to making it a reality.
