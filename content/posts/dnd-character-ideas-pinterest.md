The four types of creativity: Visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and olfactory.
Creative art is something that helps to express yourself and your thoughts. There are four different types of creativity which can be expressed through visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and olfactory means. Each type of creative expression has its own strengths and weaknesses. Visual creativity is often seen as the most direct form of creative expression. This type of creativity is often used to create artworks that are representational or specific to a certain era or culture.Auditory creativity is often used when artists need to connect with their audience in order to express their ideas. This type of creativity can be used for music, sound design, and audio production. Kinesthetic creativity is often used when artists need to explore new ways to experience the world around them.
