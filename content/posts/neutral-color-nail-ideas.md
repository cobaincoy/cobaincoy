Ideas in Action: How to start using your ideas
How to start using your ideas? It can be difficult finding the right inspiration, but with a little effort and creativity, you can get started on anything. Here are three ways to get started: 
1. Take a walk: Spending time outside is always a great way to think about new ideas. When you’re fresh and unafraid of new challenges, you may be more inspired to come up with new solutions.

The main points of the article
1. Ideas can be put into many different categories, but the three most common are: problems, solutions, and potential solutions.
2. Solutions to problems are often the easiest to find, and often have obvious solutions. However, there may be multiple possible solutions that fit the problem and still meet the goals of the solution.

3. Potential solutions are more difficult to determine, but can provide a more complete or accurate solution than either a solution or a problem. They can also be less likely to cause further problems down the road.

How to have more ideas
The ability to have more ideas is a key skill for any entrepreneur or business person. However, not all ideas are equal and some may be better than others. To find the best ideas, it’s important to assess how well they align with your goals and objectives. Here are three tips on how to have more ideas:
1. Assessment: Without giving your idea too much thought, it’s natural to want to rush into anything without first assessing its potential risks and benefits. The first step in assessing an idea is to understand its key benefits and how they could impact your business or product. Once you know these things, you can determine if the idea has potential for success.

2. Evaluation: Evaluating an idea requires taking the time to figure out what it could do for your business and what challenges you may face along the way.
