Conclusion: What advice would you give to someone interested in the future of technology?
There are a few things that anyone interested in the future of technology should keep in mind. One is to always be open to new ideas, and another is to think about what could happen if we don't take steps to improve the world around us. Here are a few ideas for future technology that might help address some of the problems we're seeing today: 
-Virtual Reality: This could be used for training or for real-world applications such as medical surgery. It's already being used in games and allows users to feel as if they are within the game or the application itself. 

-Augmented Reality: This allows users to see what they're looking at with more detail than ever before. Augmented Reality can also be used for marketing purposes, since it can give people an idea of what products they might want to buy.

What is brainstroming and what does it mean for business?
What is brainstroming and what does it mean for business?
Brainstroming is a term used to describe the activity of brainstorming. Brainstorming is an effective way to come up with new ideas and solutions to problems. When done correctly, brainstroming can lead to improved business plans, strategies and operations. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when trying to achieve brainstroming success.

1) Brainstorming should be formed into teams or groups in order to provide more cohesion. This will help prevent members from working on individual projects at the same time.
2) Brainstorming should be focused on solving real-world problems rather than just coming up with new ideas. This will help your team become more knowledgeable about the problem at hand and can help you develop better solutions.

How did invention ideas come about?
Invention ideas come about when two people think of the same idea and come up with a plan to make it a reality. Invention ideas can come from anywhere, but often they start with an idea that someone has had before. Sometimes an idea is just too good to be true, but often the realisation that it could be used in a product or service makes it all the more appealing. For example, there was once a man who came up with the idea for a computer game called "Pac-Man". This game would help children learn about mathematics and science, something that was sorely lacking in their schools at the time. Another example is the invention of the telephone. Many people at first thought it couldn't be used because it was so big and expensive, but soon realised that it could be turned into a valuable tool for communication.
