## Should I Oil An Antique Gun? [Solved]
Avoid using oils. They are not the best material for long-term protection of collection pieces as they trap dust and dirt, eventually break down and have to be periodically replaced. A high-quality light oil is fine for maintaining a gun you still shoot, though. Use a microcrystalline wax as a protective coating.25 Oct 2010
