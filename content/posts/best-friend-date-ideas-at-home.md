Brainstorming: Tips for brainstorming invention ideas
1. Looking for invention ideas can feel overwhelming, but there are a few simple brainstorming techniques that can help get the creative juices flowing.
2. One effective way to come up with invention ideas is to think about problems that you or others face on a daily basis. What are some things that you wish were different or that make your life difficult?
3. Another helpful technique is to look at other products and ask yourself how they could be improved. Is there something you don’t like about a particular product? Is there something you wish it could do? Brainstorm ways to solve these issues.
