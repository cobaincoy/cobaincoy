Trends in Technology: How will technology impact the future?
As the world moves forward, technology is likely to play an increasingly important role. Here are some ideas for what technology may mean for the future:
1. Robotics and artificial intelligence will continue to grow in importance. This will allow machines to do tasks that once required human beings, such as manufacturing and farming.

2. Virtual Reality could become more prevalent in society. This would allow people to experience different aspects of the world in a completely different way than they ever have before. It could also be used for training military and other professional roles.

3. The internet of things will continue to gain popularity. This means that devices will be able to connect with each other in order to provide services or content without either person having to leave their home.

4. New forms of energy may become popular, such as cryptocurrency and renewables like solar and wind power.

The benefits of creative art: what are they?
Creative art has many benefits for both individuals and society. Here are some of the most common: 
1) It can help improve mental health. People who are creative often have more balanced lives than those who are not, and this is especially true when it comes to their mental health. They may find it easier to cope with stress and anxiety, and they may be less likely to suffer from depression or bipolar disorder.
2) It can help people learn new skills. People who are creative often develop new skills that they would not otherwise be able to use. This is especially true for people who are good at problem-solving or creating things from scratch. These skills can then be put to use in other areas of life, such as in the workplace or in hobbies.
3) It can help people connect with others.
