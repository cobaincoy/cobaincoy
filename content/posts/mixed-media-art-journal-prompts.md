Invention is the process of coming up with a new way to do something. It can be something as simple as making a new product or invention, or it can be something more complicated like creating a machine that does something other than what was done before. Inventors are often able to come up with new ideas at any time, and they are often able to improve on the original idea until they come up with a new and improved product or invention.
