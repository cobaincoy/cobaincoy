Hi, iam Catalina Russ, Enjoy the rest of your day.
## What Are 3X Like Terms? [Solved]
Summary. Like terms are terms that have exactly the same variable and power in them—whether that's x, x3, y, or even no variable! So, for example, 2x and 3x would be like terms since they both have the variable x and they're both to the first power.

## Solve for x by combining like terms first, (8x + 1) + (3x - 2) = 32
