## Is Transtape Safer Than A Binder? [Solved]
Both Binders and TransTape are safe if used properly. Binders should only be worn for 8 hours maximum, shouldn't get wet or slept in, also shouldn't be exercised in, and cleaned properly. TransTape is actually safer than a binder. You can wear TransTape for up to 5 days, you can get it wet and sleep in it.
