What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas are everywhere, and it's hard to know where to start. Here are some ideas to get you started: 
-Start with what you know. What are some things that you enjoy doing or have a special interest in? Try thinking of ways to combine those hobbies with your creativity. 
-Explore new creative routes. Once you know some creative methods, start exploring different ways of doing things. What works for one artist might not work for another, but there is always room for growth. 
-Think outside the box. Sometimes all you need is an idea to get started on something new. Experiment until you find something that works and then copy it!

What are the possible solutions?
Ideas for the 2022 world are plentiful, but few seem likely to take hold. Even if a solution is found, it could lead to yet another global conflict. Here are some ideas that could help make the world a better place: 
1. A ban on hunting animals in national parks and nature reserves. This would help to conserve resources and protect wildlife from being hunted down and killed for sport.
2. A crackdown on money laundering and terrorist financing. Money laundering and terror financing are two of the most heinous crimes that can be committed, and they can have serious consequences for both individuals and countries. This crackdown would help to prevent these activities from happening and could have a positive impact on society as a whole.
3. More access to education for all people.

Overcoming barriers to big thinking
It's no secret that some of the world's most successful people are also some of the world's biggest thinkers. But what separates these individuals from everyone else?
For starters, they're not afraid to think big. They don't let their imaginations be limited by what's considered "normal" or "possible." Instead, they allow themselves to explore every possibility, no matter how far-fetched it may seem.

In addition to thinking big, these individuals are also willing to take risks. They know that in order to achieve something great, they may have to put everything on the line. They're not afraid of failure, because they know that even if they don't achieve their goal, they'll learn something valuable in the process.

 Finally, these individuals are persistent.
