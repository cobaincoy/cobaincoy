Conclusion: How to come up with big ideas and what they mean for your business or project.
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that always apply: think outside the box, brainstorm, and be flexible. With that in mind, here are five tips on how to come up with big ideas for your business or project: 
1. Start by thinking about what you want your business or project to achieve. What problems do you want to solve? What goals do you want to achieve? This will give you a good starting point for brainstorming ideas. 
2. Be open to other suggestions. When you’re brainstorming, don’t be afraid to take other people’s suggestions into account. If someone has an idea that sounds great but doesn’t quite fit your project, don’t be afraid to change it up a bit – after all, this is brainstorming!

The process of invention:
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that can be used in a business or other activity. It can take many different forms, but the basic process is the same: you come up with a solution to a problem and then create a prototype to see if it works.
Invention is an important part of any business, and it can help make things easier for people who are working hard to get things done. It also allows companies to keep their products and services fresh, and it makes it easier for people to find what they need when they need it.
