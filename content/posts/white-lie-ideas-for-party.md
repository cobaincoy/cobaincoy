The five types of brainstorming: open, collaborative, focused, problem-solving, and creative.
Brainstorming is one of the most essential skills for any business or professional. It can be used for creative problem solving, brainstorming for ideas for products and services, and more. However, not all brainstorming sessions are created equal. Here are five different types of brainstorming that can help improve your session productivity: 
1. Open brainstorming: This type of brainstorming is usually used when there is no specific goal to achieve or when everyone is free to come and go as they please. In this type of session, everyone is given a set amount of time to come up with ideas and then those ideas are prioritized based on how important they think they are.

2. Collaborative brainstorming: This type of brainstorming helps teams work together towards a common goal.

Overcoming obstacles to thinking big
In order to think big, we must first overcome the obstacles that prevent us from doing so. These obstacles can be both internal and external.
Internal obstacles include self-doubt, negative thinking, and a lack of confidence. We must learn to silence our inner critic and believe in ourselves before we can achieve great things.

External obstacles include other people's negativity, skepticism, and doubt. When pursuing a big idea, it is important to surround yourself with positive people who will support and encourage you.

By overcoming these obstacles, we open ourselves up to limitless possibilities. Once we start thinking big, there is no telling what we can achieve.
