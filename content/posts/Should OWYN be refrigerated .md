## Should Owyn Be Refrigerated? [Solved]
OWYN Protein RTD's do not need to be kept refrigerated prior to opening. Feel free to keep them on hand at all times - in your gym bag, locker, backpack, desk drawer or wherever you damn please. That said, for best product quality, taste and enjoyment, we recommend serving cold.
