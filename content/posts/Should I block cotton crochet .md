## Should I Block Cotton Crochet? [Solved]
Cotton should be blocked, not necessarily to get the correct shape or measurements (cotton has very little memory), but to even out any uneven tension in the piece. However, things made out of 100% acrylic will certainly benefit from a wash, but they can't be blocked out and stretched the way wool fibres can.15 Feb 2017
