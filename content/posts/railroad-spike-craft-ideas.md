2020: The year of the moon
Given that the moon is a natural satellite of Earth, it has been speculated for many years what could happen if human beings were to explore and land on the moon. And while 2020 is not necessarily the year that such a mission would be attempted, there are plenty of ideas out there for when such an endeavor could take place. Here are four examples: 
The first idea involves space travel to the moon by using a small spacecraft called Artemis. This spacecraft would be able to dock with a Russian Luna-15 spacecraft and release its astronauts in order to study the moon's surface. 
Another idea involves exploring space stations on the moon. These stations would provide research resources and rotating crews that could also conduct tasks like mining or robotic excavation. 
Lastly, we have another idea involving sending humans back down to the moon in an effort to change certain aspects of its environment.

Causes and effects of innovation
Innovation is a key term in business. It can refer to any form of change that produces new products or services. But it’s particularly important when it comes to technology, which has the ability to quickly and easily change the way people live and work.
There are a number of causes and effects of innovation, but one of the most important is how it affects companies. Innovation can create new customer relationships, improve product quality, or reduce costs. In addition, innovation can help companies attract and retain talent, which can make them better able to compete in the global market.

But while innovation is an important factor in business success, there are also some key risks associated with it. For example, some companies may experience high levels of competition from rivals who are motivated by identical or even greater innovations.
