Hola, iam James Miller, Have an A+ day.
## Should I Keep My Gas Tank Half Full? [Solved]
Keeping your fuel tank at least at the 1/4 full mark can help protect both your fuel pump and fuel filter. The fuel from the tank is pumped from the fuel pump inside the tank to the engine. In the line between the fuel tank and the engine, a fuel filter is typically present to help protect the fuel system.15 Apr 2021
