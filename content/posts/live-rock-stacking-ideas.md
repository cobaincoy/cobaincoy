Conclusion: Sum up main points.
Concluding an essay is like tying a bow on a present: it brings everything together and leaves the reader with a sense of closure. A good conclusion summarizes the main points of your essay in a concise and creative way. It leaves the reader with something to think about, whether it’s a new perspective on your topic, or a call to action. Here are some tips for writing a strong conclusion:
 Restate your thesis in different words.

Summarize your main points.

Make sure your conclusion is as strong as your introduction.

End with a bang! Leave the reader with something to remember.

A good conclusion can be the difference between an essay that’s just okay and one that really stands out. So don’t underestimate the importance of writing a great one!
