What is creative thinking?
Creative thinking is the process of coming up with new and innovative ways to solve a problem. It can be used in business, creative writing, and more. There are many creative ideas out there that you can use to improve your life or your business. Here are 8 of the most common creative thinking techniques:
1. Problem-solving: When you come up with an idea for a product or service, it’s important to have a clear problem that you can solve. This allows you to think outside the box and come up with a solution that’s novel and unique.

2. Hypothesis: Once you have a problem to solve, it’s important to generate several ideas on how to solve it. By doing this, you get a better understanding of what the problem is, as well as where potential solutions might lead.

The four types of creativity
Creativity is a complex and multi-layered concept that can be broken down into four main categories: visual, auditory, nonverbal, and cognitive. Each type of creativity has its own strengths and weaknesses.
Visual creativity is largely based on the ability to see things in a different way. This can be done through creative thought or observation, or by using one's imagination. Visual artists often use color to create unique designs or patterns.

Audio creativity involves creating sounds that are unique and appealing. This can be done through vocals, keyboards, guitars, or drums. Audio artists often use sound effects or rhythms to add interest and excitement to their work.

Nonverbal creativity occurs when people communicate their ideas through body language and facial expressions. Nonverbal artists often use eye contact, gestures, and vocal techniques to express their ideas.
