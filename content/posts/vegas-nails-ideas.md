Change 2: How to improve the efficiency of your kitchen
If you're like most people, you probably spend a lot of time in your kitchen - whether cooking or cleaning. But it's not just the act of cooking that can be improved by creating a more efficient system; cleaning and organization can also be improved. Here are some tips to help you become more efficient in your kitchen:
1. Create clear dividers between the cooking and cleaning areas. This will help create space for you to move around and do other tasks in an organized manner.

2. Use positive reinforcement when you see results from your cleanliness efforts. For example, if you see that your kitchen is dirty but you're still making progress, give yourself a pat on the back! This will keep your motivation high and make sure that you continue to make good progress.

3. Use organizers to help with storage and organization.

The creative process: How does the creative process work?
Creative ideas come to life when artists and writers share their thoughts, feelings and experiences with one another. The creative process begins with inspiration, which is the first step in developing a creative idea. Next, the artist or writer must come up with a unique concept that will capture the attention of others. Once the idea has been captured, it’s time for the writer or artist to flesh out the idea into a full-blown story or novel. Finally, unless there’s an incredible lucky streak, every book or story has to be well-researched and Fallon writes about creating new ideas on a daily basis - whether that’s coming up with an original character or imagining what might happen if she were ever given the opportunity to work on a project her own choosing.
