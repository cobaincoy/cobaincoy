The benefits of brainstroming: Increased creativity, productivity, and thought leadership.
A recent study by the University of Utah found that brainstroming – the practice of generating new ideas and solutions while under stress – can lead to increased creativity, productivity, and thought leadership. Participants in the study were given a series of challenges to work on during a set time frame, then were asked to produce ideas for a new product or service. The results showed that those who did brainstroming fared better in terms of creativity, productivity, and thought leadership than those who didn’t.
The benefits of brainstroming are clear: It can help you generate more ideas and solutions, which can result in improved productivity and overall thinking skills. Whether you’re looking to boosting your business acumen or simply sparking new thinking ideas, brainstroming is an essential tool for success.

How do we make sure that our technology helps us achieve our goals rather than hinder them?
Technology has a lot to offer in helping us achieve our goals, but it should be used responsibly. There are a number of ways technology can help us achieve our goals, but some are more harmful than others. Here are three examples: 
1. Technology can help us automate tasks and reduce the amount of time we have to spend on them. This can lead to decreased productivity and increased workloads. 
2. Technology can help us communicate with other people and devices more easily. This can lead to less communication and collaboration between team members. 
3. Technology can help us track our progress and organize our work more effectively. This can lead to better management of resources and improved productivity overall.
