1. Innovation can refer to any change that makes a product or service better or more efficient.
2. Innovation can refer to any approach that is different from the norm in order to improve customer satisfaction or business success.

The creative process
When it comes to the creative process, there are a few key things to keep in mind. First and foremost, it’s important to be open-minded and willing to experiment. Secondly, don’t be afraid to take risks – creativity often comes from stepping outside of your comfort zone. And finally, trust your instincts; if something feels right, go with it.
Of course, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to creativity; what works for one person may not work for another. But keeping these general principles in mind can help you tap into your own creativity and come up with new and innovative ideas.
