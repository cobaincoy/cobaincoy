## Is There A Limit For Medical Marijuanas In Pa? [Solved]
Medical marijuana dispensaries are permitted to sell up to a 90-day supply of the medicine to a patient. Records must be kept of each amount obtained. Patients can then "re-up" their 90 days supplies in the last 7 days of the amount they have, in order to get a refill. These limits are strictly enforced.
