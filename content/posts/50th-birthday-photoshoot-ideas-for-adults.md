The history of invention ideas: How has innovation changed over time?
Invention ideas have changed over time, and as a result, the history of Invention Ideas is reflective of that. One way invention ideas have changed is in how they are created.  In the past, invention ideas were often based on scientific understanding at the time they were conceived. However, as technology advances and new knowledge becomes available, more and more innovation ideas are born from scratch. This new creativity allows for faster response tochanging needs and developments in technology.
One example of this new creativity is the cellular phone. Cellular phones were first invented back in 1984 by American scientist Neil Armstrong and his colleague Rick Stratham. The telephone was originally designed to be a basic communication resource for soldiers in war-time. However, after seeing how useful cellular phones could be for civilians, Armstrong and Stratham decided to create a product that could be used by everyone including business people and everyday citizens.

What is innovation?
Innovation is a process of creating new ideas, products, or services that are different from what is already out there. It can also be seen as the change that occurs in the way we use and think about things. Innovation is often seen as something good, like new ways to make our food or clothes. However, sometimes innovation can also be bad, like a new way of advertising that isn't effective.

Risks and Opportunities of Innovation
Innovation is one of the most important aspects of any business. It can bring new ideas and products to market, which in turn can save businesses money and increase sales. However, there are always potential risks associated with innovation. For example, innovation can lead to new technologies that are unproven or difficult to use, which could lead to errors or failures. Additionally, innovation can also lead to companies becoming too reliant on outside sources for their products or services, which could create conflicts of interest or problems with partner relationships. Overall, it is important for businesses to be aware of the risks and opportunities associated with innovation and make sure that they are taken into account when planning and conducting business activities.
