The history of invention: How have some inventions been used and what benefits have they brought?
Invention ideas are a core part of the history of technology. From ancient times to the present, people have come up with new ways to do things. Some inventions have been helpful and others have not. The history of invention is full of examples of both. Here are three examples:
The incandescent light bulb was first invented in 1879 by Jewish inventor Samuel Morse. It used a filament that was heated by an oven to create light.

The phonograph was invented in 1877 by Phonograph Company president Edward Emmons and his brother George. They created a machine that could play sound files on a screen.

The modern computer was invented in 1947 by John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry at Bell Labs in New York City. It uses vacuum tubes to process information instead of magic numbers and letters like earlier computers did.

What is an invention?
Invention is a complex legal term that refers to any creative or original idea, product, service, or process. There are many different types of inventions, but some of the most common are ideas for new products, services, or processes. Inventions can be created by anyone from small businesses to large companies. There are many different ways to get an invention off the ground, and there is no one right way to do it. There are a number of factors you need to take into account when creating an invention: the inventor’s skills and experience, the technology they rely on, and the market opportunity.
