The Use of Invention: What are some examples?
Invention is the use of a creative idea, or a new method or process, to produce a product or service. Invention can come from anywhere: in your mind, in your backyard, on the internet, or even from someone you know. 
There are many examples of invention. For example, think about the wheel- an invention that changed the way we move around. There are also inventions that have had huge impacts on society and the world like the telephone, antibiotics, and jet engines- all of which were invented by people who were not just working on their own but were part of a team. 
Inventions can be really amazing or really terrible. But they always have a big impact because they help us do things that we couldn't do before and they make our lives easier.
