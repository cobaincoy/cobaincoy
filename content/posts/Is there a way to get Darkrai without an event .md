## Is There A Way To Get Darkrai Without An Event? [Solved]
Unfortunately, the only official way to get the Member's Card is by attending a Nintendo event which ended in 2009. You can still get Darkrai, but you will need to perform void glitch that gets you to an darkrai encounter, or use an Action Replay to hack the game.8 Oct 2020
