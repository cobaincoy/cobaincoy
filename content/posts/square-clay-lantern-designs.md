New Ideas in Mathematics offers a different approach, which is based on using problem-solving techniques to learn more about the math concepts. This type of learning is often more fun and efficient than watching lectures or reading textbooks.

Overcoming creative blocks:
When it comes to creative blocks, the best way to overcome them is to be prepared with a toolkit of ideas. This way, when you hit a wall, you have something to fall back on. Here are four tips for ensuring that your toolkit is always full:
1. Be curious and ask questions: When you're stuck, it's often because you're not sure what you want to achieve. Asking yourself - and others - questions can help clarify your goals, and open up new possibilities for how to achieve them.

2. Take inspiration from others: A great way to jump-start your own creativity is to look at what others have done. See what inspires you, and then adapt those ideas to your own purposes.

3. Give yourself time and space: Rushing into things rarely leads to good results.
