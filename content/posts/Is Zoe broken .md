## Is Zoe Broken? [Solved]
No. Zoe has one of the best burst damage combos in League of Legends, but she is NOT broken. Her playstyle revolves around setting up kills with her E – Sleepy Trouble Bubble. You can easily counter this ability with items like Zhonya's Hourglass and Quicksilver Sash, as well as Cleanse.12 Sept 2021
