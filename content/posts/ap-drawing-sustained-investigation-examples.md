Creativity is often thought of as a power that individuals have. However, creativity can also be used to solve problems or create new ideas. In fact, creativity can even be used to improve oneâ€™s life overall. There are many benefits to using creativity in your everyday life, and it can be a powerful tool for solving problems or creating new ideas. Here are three examples of how creativity can help you:
