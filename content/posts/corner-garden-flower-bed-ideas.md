Types of innovation: How they work
Innovation is the process of creating new products or services that are different from those that have been previously created. Innovation can be found in all industries, but is most common in the technology industry. In order to create innovative products or services, companies must first come up with a new idea, and then develop and test it so that it works. There are a number of different types of innovation, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. 
Product innovation: This type of innovation usually occurs when a company comes up with a new product idea that they believe will be successful. They then work on developing the product until it is ready to sell. Product development can be time-consuming, but can also lead to high profits if the product is successful. 

Service innovation: This type of innovation often occurs when companies come up with new ways to provide their customers with service.

Why it's important to have a growth plan
It's important to have a growth plan because it sets expectations for the future and helps you stay on track. By knowing what you want, and how to get there, you can create an achievable plan that will help your business grow. Here are three key ideas to help build your growth plan: 
1. Know your industry and where you fit in. Knowing where your business is in the market and what competition is doing will help you determine what needs to be done next in order for your business to stay afloat. 
2. Create a market research strategy. Doing market research will help identify which channels work best for your audience and which ones need more attention or marketing investment. Doing this before starting any new project helps minimize surprises later on. 
3. Set realistic goals and timetables.
