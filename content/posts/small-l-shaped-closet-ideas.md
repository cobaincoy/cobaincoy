How can you develop big ideas?
Developing big ideas is one of the most important skills you can have as a businessperson. It's easy to come up with good ideas, but it's even easier to turn them into successful businesses. Here are three tips to help you develop big ideas:
1. Make a list of all the possible solutions to your problem. This will give you a range of options to consider when coming up with potential solutions.

2. Break your problem down into smaller, more manageable chunks. This will make it easier to focus on solving each individual piece of the puzzle and creating a solution that meets your needs and goals.

3. Talk with other people about your idea.
