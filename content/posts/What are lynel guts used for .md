## What Are Lynel Guts Used For? [Solved]
Lynel Guts are Monster Parts that can be dropped by all types of Lynels upon their defeats. They pulse with the vitality of a Lynel, which makes them useful for making Elixirs in a Cooking Pot. They can also be used at the Kochi Dye Shop to make Crimson Dye or exchanged for Mon at the Fang and Bone.
