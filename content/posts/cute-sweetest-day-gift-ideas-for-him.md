Why are big ideas important?
When it comes to big ideas, there are two types: the great ones and the impossible ones. Great ideas are those that have the potential to change the world, but they also come with a lot of risk. Only then can they be abandoned or even reconsidered, as is the case with Google’s Street View. Impossible ideas are those that are so outlandish and out of reach that no one has yet proposed them. This is why big ideas need to be considered carefully before being implemented, just as with any other idea.

How to invent something: Share tips on how to come up with new ideas.
Invention is the process of creating something new, whether it’s a product, process or service. It’s a key part of innovation and economic growth. To be successful, you need to have a good idea and the drive to see it through.
So how do you come up with new ideas? There are a few methods you can try:

1. Brainstorming: This is a great way to generate ideas with a group. Get together with some friends or colleagues and just start throwing out ideas. The more outrageous the better – you can always tone it down later. The point is to get the creative juices flowing and come up with as many ideas as possible.

2. Research: Sometimes the best ideas come from understanding what already exists and finding ways to improve upon it.
