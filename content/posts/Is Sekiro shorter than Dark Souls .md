Hola, iam Gerald Scott, Have a splendid day!
## Is Sekiro Shorter Than Dark Souls? [Solved]
All souls games are very short including Sekiro when you run through the arenas. But when you collect items and fight enemies they get much longer. I always take my time for the first playthrough. same but even if you fight every mini boss, get all items, health upgrades and prosthetic upgrades, its still shorter.17 Apr 2019
