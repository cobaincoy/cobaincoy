What is brainstroming?
What is brainstroming? It’s a phenomenon that has baffled scientists for centuries. They can’t explain it, but they know it exists. Brainstroming is when a person’s thoughts and ideas are constantly going through their head, like the thoughts of a machine. The problem is, nobody knows why this happens or how to stop it. Some people say that brainstroming is caused by mental exhaustion or stress, while others say it’s the result of some sort of mental enhancement. There isn’t one answer to this question, and scientists are still trying to figure out what causes brainstroming and how to stop it.

What are big ideas?
In business, big ideas are the seeds of new business models and products. They can be anything from a novel idea to a radical change in how a product is produced. They can also be inspired by something that has worked before, or by something that someone else has tried and found to be successful. 
The key to getting your big idea off the ground is to have a clear vision for it, and then come up with specific goals and timelines for making it a reality. There are several ways to generate big ideas, including brainstorming with friends or family, talking with experts in your field, researching existing products or services, or reading articles on the subject. 

If you're not sure what kind of big idea you want to pursue, there are plenty of resources available to help you get started.

Cut down on expenses: How do you save money on your everyday items?
When it comes to spending money, most people tend to do things the same way over and over again. That is, they try to save money by doing everything they can. However, if you want to save money on your everyday items, there are a few ways you can do this. One way is to cut down on your expenses by making small changes in your behavior. For example, rather than spending $5 on a movie ticket every time you go out with friends, spend $3 or $2 instead. Another way of saving money is by shopping at thrift stores or sale areas. There are usually sales going on all the time at these places so you can get good deals on your everyday items.
