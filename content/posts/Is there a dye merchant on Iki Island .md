Hi, iam Jacqueline Glover, Hope you're doing good!
## Is There A Dye Merchant On Iki Island? [Solved]
The Crimson dye merchant can be found on Iki Island, which players can gain access to if they own the DLC or the Director's Cut. To get to Iki Island, players will need to at least be in Chapter 2 of Ghost of Tsushima's main story. Only then will the questline appear in the Iki Tales section of the menu.21 Aug 2021
