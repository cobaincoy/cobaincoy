The three types of big ideas: A crazy idea, a good idea, and a bad idea
There are three types of big ideas: crazy, good, and bad. Crazy ideas are always exciting, and can help to change the course of history. Good ideas have the potential to make a big impact on people and the world. However, there is always risk associated with them- some might be great, while others might not be so great after all. But when it comes time to make a decision, it’s important to weigh the risks and benefits of each idea before coming up with a decision.
Bad Ideas are simply terrible, and often have no chance of becoming anything other than infamous failures. They may seem like something that could never work or might even lead to disaster- but in reality, they often do just that. It’s important to be vigilant when assessing any new idea- especially those with such potential for disaster.

what are big ideas?
What are Big Ideas?
In education, a big idea is a broad concept that provides a unifying structure for a lesson or unit. It helps students connect new information to what they already know and understand. Big ideas should be open-ended and complex, allowing students to explore them in depth.

Big ideas help students see the world in new ways and make connections between different concepts. They encourage higher-level thinking and promote deeper understanding. When students can articulate the big ideas in a subject, they have mastered the essential content and skills.

Benefits and Risks of Invention: What are the benefits and risks of an innovation?
Invention can be defined as the process of coming up with a new idea, product or service. There are many benefits to invention, ranging from creating new products and services to saving lives and improving the quality of life. However, there are also risks associated with innovation, including the risk of losing valuable technology or intellectual property. Here are four key Benefits of Invention: 
1) Innovation can create new opportunities for businesses and individuals. When a company comes up with a new product or service, it can now sell those ideas and products to other companies and consumers around the world. This creates economic opportunity for businesses and allows people to have more choices in what they eat, drink and wear. 

2) Innovation can help improve the quality of life for people around the world. Inventions can save lives by making it easier for people to get medical treatment or cure diseases.

But what happens when these advancements come at the cost of our privacy? The answer is often a disaster, as we're constantly given new tools to be used without our consent, without any thought given to how they might impact our individual rights and liberties.
