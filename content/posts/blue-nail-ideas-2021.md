History of Invention: How did invention come about?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that had not been considered before. Invention has been around for centuries, and it began with the Greeks. In their manual The Iliad, Homer mentions the invention of the bow and arrow, which he says was created by Menelaus. Other ancient authors also mention the invention of new technologies. For example, Theophrastus wrote about a machine that could turn any object into wine, which he called the “Wine Maker”. The Chinese also invented various products such as silkworm cocoons and books in the 4th century BC.

What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas can help you achieve success in any field, even if you don't have a lot of experience. They can also help you get your idea off the ground and into a full-blown business venture. Here are four benefits of having ideas: 
1. You'll be more confident when starting a new project. When you have an idea, it feels like there's something to believe in. This confidence will help you start and finish projects with greater efficiency, and it will make sure that your ideas actually turn into reality. 
2. You'll be more organized when brainstorming new ideas. Having an idea always means that there's a potential solution that you haven't considered before! This will enable you to come up with better ideas for projects, faster than if you didn't think about it at all.
