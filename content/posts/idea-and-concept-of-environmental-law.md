The future of creative art: What changes are likely to occur in the future and why?
Creative art has been around for centuries and is a key part of many cultures. However, with the advent of new technologies and an ever-growing population, the future of creative art is uncertain. Some experts predict that creativity will become more subdued and that it will be replaced by more factual or technological-based art. Others predict that creativity will continue to thrive and that it will be used in more creative ways. There are many potential reasons why this may happen, but one thing is for sure: the future of creative art is still largely unknown.

Historical overview: How has the definition of invention changed over time?
Invention has undergone many changes throughout history. Over time, the definition of what qualifies as an invention has varied, in large part due to the development of new technologies. Today, invention typically refers to any innovation that is not simply a modification or improvement on something that has been done before. This includes developments in fields such as engineering and technology, but also includes ideas and concepts that may never have been put into practice.
One of the most significant changes to the definition of invention occurred in the early 1800s, when advances in technology led to a proliferation of new ideas for products and services that could be called inventions. Prior to this period, most innovations were seen as improvements on existing concepts or methods. This changed with the introduction of steam power and other technologies that allowed for more complex machines and processes.
