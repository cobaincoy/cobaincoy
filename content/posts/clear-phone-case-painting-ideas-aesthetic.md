Trends in artificial intelligence (AI): What new sources of AI will we see in the next few years?
AI is becoming more and more pervasive in our daily lives, with a number of startups and companies working on various AI projects. Some of the most important trends that are expected to take place in the next few years include:
1. More automated intelligent agents – This trend is already being seen in some industries, such as retail, where machines are increasingly able to carry out tasks that used to be carried out by human beings. The hope is that this will eventually lead to increased efficiency and savings for businesses.

2. Machine learning – This field is rapidly developing and has the potential to change many aspects of our lives, from business to healthcare. It involves building algorithms that can learn from data and make decisions on their own. This could lead to huge improvements in our understanding of the world around us, as well as new ways of detecting and responding to dangerous situations.

brain washing: How can people be made to do things they don't want to do?
How can people be made to do things they don't want to do? There are many ways, but some of the most common methods are brainwashing and suggestion. Brainwashing is a process of inducing someone to change their views or behavior by using persuasive techniques. suggesting someone does something based on their eagerness or attraction often works better than actual coercion. Brainwashing techniques typically range from subtle (like reinforcing positive thoughts) to blatant (such as convincing someone that they have no choice in the matter). 
There are a few different types of brainwashing, but the most common is suggestion. Suggestion is when you say something that might make someone do something they wouldn't normally do. For example, if you tell a person they have to go outside for 5 minutes, that might suggest to them that it's time for them to get up and leave.

What are some new ideas?
A recent report on the future of technology suggests that a number of new ideas are emerging for improving ways to connect people and create opportunities. One such idea is the use of robots to help with tasks that traditional humans find difficult or time-consuming, such as packaging goods, loading onto a truck, or cleaning. Another is the development of artificial intelligence (AI)powered assistants that can assist people with their day-to-day tasks, from booking appointments to grocery shopping. While these ideas may seem like small tweaks to existing workflows, they could have large implications for businesses and society as a whole.
