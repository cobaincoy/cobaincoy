Conclusion: How can we address the big ideas and challenges in our society?
In recent decades, there has been a growing interest in big ideas and challenges in our society. This trend began to take root in the 1970s with the work of Murray Bookchin, and has continued to grow in recent years as more people have become interested in concepts such as human emancipation, sustainability, and democracy.
There are a number of big ideas that need to be addressed if we want to see a flourishing society that is both sustainable and emancipatory. Here are three examples:

1) We need a new understanding of what it means to be human. We currently operate within a systems-based view of being human, which values materialism over spiritual development. This perspective creates obstacles for humans as they try to find their place within the world.

2) We need a new understanding of how social movements can work together.

Trends in computing: What new ways will information and communication technologies change the way we use and understand our world?
Technology has always had a huge impact on our lives. The development of information and communication technologies has led to a whole new level of interactivity and understanding between people and the world around them. Some of the most significant changes that will occur in this area are as follows:
1) New ways of communicating: Communication is now an integral part of everyday life, and it has changed immensely in the past few decades. Gone are the days where people communicated through written documents or talking with friends over weekly phone calls. These days, we communicate through digital platforms such as social media, text messages, and even emails. This allows us to be more connected to each other and share ideas and experiences at any time, anywhere.
