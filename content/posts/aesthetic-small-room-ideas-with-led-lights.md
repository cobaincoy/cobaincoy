Introduce the topic of creative ideas.
Creative ideas are the core of what drives businesses and industries. They are what inspire people to come up with new products, services, and ways of doing things. Many businesses have creative departments or teams whose sole purpose is to generate new ideas.
There are a number of ways to generate new ideas. One is brainstorming, which is when a group of people get together and try to come up with as many ideas as possible, without judging or critiquing them. Another way is to look at what other businesses are doing and see if there’s something you can improve upon or do differently.

You can also try asking customers or clients what they would like to see from your business. Sometimes the best ideas come from the people who are actually using your products or services. And don’t forget about your employees!

Different types of innovation: What are some common examples?
Innovation is a term that has been used for centuries to describe different types of change. Different types of innovation can be described in two ways: product and process innovation. Product innovation refers to the development of a new product, while process innovation refers to the improvement of a process, such as adding new technology or modifying an existing one. 
Product innovation usually occurs when two companies come up with a new product that is better than what was before. Process innovation, on the other hand, often happens when companies try to improve an existing process so it can be more efficient and accurate. This can involve adding new technology or changing how an old process is run.
