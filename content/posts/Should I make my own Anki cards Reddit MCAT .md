## Should I Make My Own Anki Cards Reddit Mcat? [Solved]
Making your own deck is nice because it's more exposure and reptition, but you're right it takes wayyyyyyy too long. I would highly recommend downloading a premade deck. I usually at least read the content before doing the cards so I'm not totally blindsided, but making your own cards is definitely a waste of time imo.2 Jun 2021
