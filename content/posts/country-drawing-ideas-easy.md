The Challenge of Innovation: How do we ensure that innovations are successful?
Innovation has always been a challenge. What makes it so difficult is that it often hinges on the right decisions and the right team. Today, with advancements in technology, innovation is even more important. Here are three challenges that need to be overcome if innovation is to succeed:
1. The Myth of the One True Idea
 knapsackers faced a similar challenge when they sought ways to improve their productivity. “There was only one way to do it, and that was by following the recipe,” says Allen Weinberg, MIT mathematician and co-author of The Art of Computer Programming.

This limits creativity and variety in the marketplace, which can lead to success or failure in innovation.
