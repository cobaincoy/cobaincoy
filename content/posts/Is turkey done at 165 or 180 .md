## Is Turkey Done At 165 Or 180? [Solved]
Insert it close to, but not touching, the thigh bone. If it reads 180 degrees F in the thigh and 170 degrees F in the breast, it's done and ready to serve. (If it's stuffed, check the center of the stuffing to make sure it's 165 degrees F as well.) Need help using your meat thermometer?
