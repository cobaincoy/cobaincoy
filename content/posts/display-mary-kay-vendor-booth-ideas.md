Taking Action: How do you take action when you have creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new products to a better way to do things. When you have creative ideas, it can be hard to know what to do with them. Here are three tips for taking action on your ideas:
1. Research your idea thoroughly before starting anything. This will help you understand the feasibility of the idea and whether or not it is something that is possible or even desirable.

2. Make a prototype of your idea. This will give you a rough idea of how your product or service will look and feel. You can then test this out on customers or see if there is enough demand for the idea to actually start manufacturing it.

3. Take action! Once you have some prototypes and data, it’s time to take action!

Invention: A Process
Invention is a process. It involves coming up with a new idea, working on it until it’s perfected, and then bringing that idea to the world.

One of the most common methods is brainstorming, which can help you come up with ideas for products or services. Other methods include developing a prototype, testing it out on people or animals, and seeing if anyone likes it. If you’re not sure how to come up with an invention, there are plenty of resources available online or in books to help you.

What are the options for ideas?
Ideas are a valuable asset for businesses and individuals. They can be used to generate new ideas, come up with new products or services, or come up with new ways of doing things. Unfortunately, not every idea is a good one. Sometimes ideas are just too crazy or too innovative for the marketplace to take on. There are two ways to overcome this obstacle: 1) Find a market for your idea and 2) Make sure your idea is something that the market wants.
