Evaluation methods
Evaluating ideas for inventions can be difficult. There are many factors to consider when trying to decide if an invention is worth pursuing. The first step is to come up with a list of criteria that the invention must meet. Once you have a list of criteria, you can start evaluating ideas against those criteria.
Some factors to consider when evaluating invention ideas include: market potential, patentability, manufacturing feasibility, and profitability. Other important considerations include: how unique the idea is, how much it will cost to develop and produce the invention, and whether there is a demand for the invention.

The best way to evaluate an invention idea is to consult with experts in the field. These experts can help you determine if an idea has potential and is worth pursuing. They can also provide guidance on how to develop and commercialize the invention.

Invention and technology: How has innovation changed over the years?
Invention has always been a major part of human history. From the invention of fire to the development of cars, people have used their ingenuity to make new products and technologies. However, innovation has changed over time, as it has become more and more difficult to come up with new ideas. This is due to a variety of reasons, some of which are global in scope and others specific to each country or industry.
One example of how innovation has changed over time is in the field of telecommunications. With the advent of technology such as radio and television, people were able to communicate with one another far easier than they had ever before. This made it possible for businesses and governments to connect with a wider audience, which in turn led to increased profits and growth. However, while this change was beneficial overall, it also caused some problems.

Impact of innovation on society and economy:
Innovation is an ever-growing movement in the economy that leads to new products, services and businesses. It is also a key factor in society; innovations often lead to changes in social norms and the way people interact. The impact of innovation on society and economy has been studied for many years and there are some clear conclusions about what types of innovation have the biggest impact. 
One clear conclusion is that innovative activity can have a significant positive impact on society if it meets three conditions: it should be done in a way that does not harm others, it should be affordable for everyone, and it should be able to create jobs. However, even when innovations meet these conditions, they can still have a negative impact on society if they do not meet other specific requirements.
