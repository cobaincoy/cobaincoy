Invention of the Telephone
In 1876, American scientist Samuel Morse and his assistant Alfred Vail developed the first practical telephone.

The telephone had a number of benefits, including allowing for longer conversations, making it easier to reach people in remote areas, and helping people stay connected at night. The telephone is still an important part of our lives today.

The three types of creativity: Intuitive, Analytical, and Exact
Creativity is a result of the interaction between two or more factors. These factors can be called intuition and analysis, or exactly. Intuitive creativity is the result of an individual's natural ability to connect with the world and see patterns. Analytical creativity is founded on reason and analysis, which can help individuals see how things work and how they can be improved. 
Exact creativity is when an individual has a specific idea and they go into deep analysis to make it a reality. This type of creativity often requires focus and dedication, as it can be difficult to change your mind after you have initial ideas. However, if done correctly, this type of creativity can lead to amazing products and solutions.
