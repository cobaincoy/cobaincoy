The scientific and technological revolutions: What did these change about the definition of invention?
Invention is a definition that has been in use for centuries. However, during the last two hundred years, there have been several technological revolutions that have redefine what it means to be an inventor. The first of these was the introduction of the machine gun in the late eighteenth century. This change in technology allowed armies to fight on a much larger scale and made war possible for the first time. The second revolution was the development of computers in the late twentieth century. This change in technology allowed scientists and doctors to interface with each other on a much more personal level and permitted them to create new medical cures and treatments. These technological changes have had a significant impact on society and economy, and have led to new ideas about how invention works.
