What are the top Ideas for 2022?
Looking to 2020, some potential ideas for the year 2022 include: 
1) In order to increase youth engagement with politics and policy, the government should provide more opportunities for marginalized groups like youth of color and low-income families to participate in civic engagement. 
2) To create an engaged electorate, the government could invest in marketing and public education campaigns that promote informed voting. 
3) To promote economic growth and create jobs, the government should focus on initiatives like issuing tax breaks and investing in renewable energy sources. 
4) To improve quality of life for residents, the government should focus on issues like affordable housing, accessible education, health care access, and green infrastructure. 
5) To keep up with changing technology trends, the government could consider promoting early childhood development programming and offering free or reduced-cost online courses.
