Contemporary Inventions: The computer, the internet, 3D printing
Invention is the key to progress. It is what takes us from the horse and buggy to the automobile, from telegraphs to telephones, from mainframe computers to laptops. And it is what has given us 3D printing, a technology that has the potential to change manufacturing as we know it.
3D printing is an additive manufacturing process, which means that it builds objects by adding layers of material one at a time. This is in contrast to subtractive manufacturing processes like CNC machining, which involve cutting away material to create an object.

3D printing has been around for decades, but it has only recently become accessible to consumers and small businesses. Thanks to advances in 3D printer technology and the availability of affordable 3D printers, this transformative technology is now within reach of anyone with an idea and a bit of creativity.

The history of creative art: How does it start?
Creative art has a long and complex history, with different people and cultures contributing to its creation. One of the earliest examples of creative art was considered to be cave art, which was discovered in France in the late 1800s. This type of art involved artists creating pieces out of natural materials such as flint and obsidian. It is thought that these artists used their creativity to escape from reality and explore their inner world. From there, other forms of creative art began to emerge, including sculpture and painting. While both types of art have their own unique strengths, they are united by the fact that they are created using inspiration and ideas from outside of the artist’s own experience.
