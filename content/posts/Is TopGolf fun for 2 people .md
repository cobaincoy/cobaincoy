Hi, iam Irving Shaffer, Have a nice day.
## Is Topgolf Fun For 2 People? [Solved]
It is fun as a solo date or group date (in each bay up to 6 people can play at once!) You can dine there or get drinks while you play. You don't need your own gear - they have it all there! You can play even if you aren't any good at golf.4 Mar 2019
