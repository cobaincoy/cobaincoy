Greetings, iam Homer Ortiz, Have an awesome day!
## What Are Nasus Stacks? [Solved]
 The game from here on is self-explanatory. Nasus is a ramping champion, the more stacks you have the easier it is to get more. Continue to split push, using TP to help your team, but remember your stacks — By the time you hit 400, you thrash any and all enemies who get into your range. At 500, you win the game.1 Feb 2022
