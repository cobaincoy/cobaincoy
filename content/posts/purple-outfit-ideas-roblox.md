What are some new ideas?
There are a lot of new ideas out there these days. Here are some of the most popular: 
1) Introduction to computer programming – This is a new course that has been moderately successful in increasing interest in computer science. It covers everything from basic coding to more complex topics, making it an excellent introduction to the field for those who want to start homebrewing or develop their own software projects. 
2) A way for people with mental health conditions to interact with the world – This is a trend that is growing slowly but surely, as more and more people realize just how important it is for people with mental health conditions to have access to support and information (and not just be left on their own). Some companies are starting to create websites and apps specifically for people with mental health conditions, so this trend is only going to continue growing.

The difference between brainstorming and coming up with solutions: Some key distinctions.
Some people might define brainstorming as coming up with ideas, while others might say that brainstorming is actually coming up with solutions to problems. In either case, the main difference between brainstorming and coming up with solutions lies in how the two activities are done.
In terms of how brainstorming is typically done, participants put together a list of ideas and then work on developing one or more possible solutions. This usually happens in small groups, which allows for each person to share their ideas and receive feedback.

Coming up with solutions, on the other hand, is typically a more solitary process. Participants typically work on tackle one or a few problems at a time and then come up with a plan to achieve their goals. Sometimes this occurs in group settings, but most times it’s best if someone alone comes up with the solution to a problem.
