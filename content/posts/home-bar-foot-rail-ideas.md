Implementation: How do you go about using new ideas to improve your business or organization?
When it comes to implementing new ideas, creativity is key. This is why businesses and organizations should take the time to brainstorm what they would like to accomplish with their new initiatives. After all, if a business does not have any clear goals or objectives, it will be difficult to put together a successful plan of action.
One way to come up with specific goals and objectives for your new initiative is by using a brainstorming tool. The most popular option for this is called Scrum, which stands for “Scenario Planning and Reworking in Construction”. This tool allows businesses and organizations to come up with specific goals that need to be accomplished in order for them to meet a certain deadline.

Another great way to come up with specific goals is by using SWOT analysis.

Brainstorming: What are some great ways to come up with new ideas?
This article is about brainstorming ideas, and how to come up with new ones. There are a few things to keep in mind when brainstorming: 
- Make sure you have a wide range of ideas - Brainstorming can be helpful if you have a few good ideas but no specific plan for calling them all together. 

- Be organized - When you have a bunch of great ideas, it can be helpful to jot them down in order of importance. This will help you keep track of what's important and which ones need more work. 

- Be patient - It can take some time to come up with good ideas. Don't get discouraged if your first batch doesn't seem as great as you wanted it to. You can always try again later.
