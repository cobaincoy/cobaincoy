Summary: What are the benefits of having more ideas?
Ideas are the lifeblood of any creative business. They can change how you think and how you operate, giving your business the power to succeed. But what are the benefits of having more ideas? Here are five key ones:
1. You can be more productive. When you have more ideas, you're less likely to get bogged down in a same-old routine and therefore have more time to complete projects.
2. You can be more innovative. By having more ideas, you're less likely to follow someone else's plan and get stuck with something that's not working.
3. You can be better organized. Having lots of ideas means being able to see things from a different perspective and then coming up with a plan for dealing with those perspectives in order to make things work well together.
4. You can be cheaper and faster than ever before.

Conclusion: Some tips for starting off on a fresh thinking project.
