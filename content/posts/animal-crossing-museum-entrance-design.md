The process of innovation
Innovation is a process that can be divided into four distinct stages: ideation, development, implementation, and diffusion.
Ideation is the stage in which new ideas are generated. This can involve brainstorming sessions, market research, or simply observing the world around you. Once an idea has been generated, it must be developed. This stage includes testing the feasibility of the idea and refining it until it is ready to be implemented.

Implementation is when the innovative idea is put into practice. This stage can be challenging, as it requires bringing the idea to life and making it work within the context of your business or organisation. Diffusion is the final stage of innovation, and refers to how widely the new idea is adopted. This stage is often influenced by factors such as marketing and word-of-mouth.

How can we come up with big ideas?
One of the great things about being a creativity seeker is that you have all sorts of ways to get your ideas off the ground. You can brainstorm, come up with new concepts, or simply think outside the box. Here are a few tips on how to come up with big ideas:
1) Talk with other people: When you’re brainstorming, it can be helpful to talk with others. This will help you share your thoughts and get feedback. It can also help you create a group consensus on what should be done next.

2) Be open-minded: When it comes tobig ideas, it’s important not to be too tighten-lipped about what you want. If you’re hesitant or afraid of what might happen, it will likely stay bottled up inside and won’t lead to any big Ideas.

The benefits of big ideas
Big Ideas can have a significant impact on people’s lives and the world around them. By sharing great ideas with the world, we can help make a positive change. Here are 5 of the best big ideas around: 
1. Let people know their options – large groups of people can be very intimidating, especially if you don’t have an idea for something. Let them know there are many different ways to solve a problem and that they don’t have to choose one. This will open their eyes and give them more options. 
2. Give people power – often times, the most important thing is giving people control over their lives in some way shape or form. In order to do this, you need to share your idea with as many people as possible so that everyone has an equal say in what happens next.
