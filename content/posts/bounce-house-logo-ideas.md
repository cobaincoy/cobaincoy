What are some common ways to generate ideas?
Ideas can come from a variety of places, including the mind, the heart, or the spirit. They might be sparked by something you see around you or hear in conversation, or they might be made up on your own. But whatever their source, ideas are a powerful thing and can help you think of ways to improve your life or solve a problem. Here are four tips on how to generate more ideas: 
1. Take some time for yourself – especially if you find that you don’t typically have time for creative thinking.

This could be anything from reading an interesting book to taking a walk outside.
