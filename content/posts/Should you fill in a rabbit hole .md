## Should You Fill In A Rabbit Hole? [Solved]
 Locate the rabbit holes and fill them in with dirt, rocks, gravel, sand or concrete. Concrete is the best method and will keep rabbits from reusing the hole, however, it will also render the land useless. Filling in the whole with some gravel and then dirt should keep it usable and rabbit-free.
