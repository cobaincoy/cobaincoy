What is brainstroming?
There is no one specific definition for brainstroming, but the phenomenon is typically defined as a state of high stress and anxiety caused by a combination of external factors (such as social media) and internal factors (such as personal thoughts or feelings). Brainstroming can be described as an intense feeling of focus, productivity, and clarity. It can be a great force for turning around projects and getting things done. However, it can also lead to feelings of stress, anxiety, and uncertainty. There are a few key steps you can take to reduce or avoid brainstroming: understand your triggers, set goals, and stay organized.
