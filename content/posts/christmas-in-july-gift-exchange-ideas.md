Creative process: How does the creative process work, and how does it differ from other forms of intelligence?
Creative process: How does it work?
There is no one answer to this question as the creative process is different for everyone. However, there are some general principles that can be followed to help create valuable and successful products or ideas. 

The creative process begins with the idea or concept. This can be anything from a question that needs to be answered to a plan of how something should be done. From here, it is up to the individual to decide whether they want to pursue the idea or not. If they do, they will need some help in order to turn it into a reality. This includes coming up with a name, designing the prototype, and making sure everything is ready for production. Once all of these steps are complete, it is finally up to the customer or user to test and give feedback before finalizing their decision.

Big Data: How big data is changing the way businesses operate and what implications this has for everything from marketing to customer service.
Big data is now a big part of business operations. How this affects everything from marketing to customer service is a topic of debate. Some businesses see big data as a way to increase efficiency and make decisions faster, while others are concerned that it could have negative consequences. Here are four examples of how big data is changing the business landscape:
1) They're using big data to assess customer needs and then cater to them with tailored marketing campaigns. Previously, businesses conducted marketing research through questionnaire surveys or focus groups. With big data, businesses can now use machine learning algorithms to analyze huge amounts of information about customers in order to better understand their needs and preferences. This allows companies to identify what products or services are most popular and need improvement, which in turn can lead to new product development or even new sales campaigns.
