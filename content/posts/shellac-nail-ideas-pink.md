Creative process: How does the creative process work, and how does it differ from other forms of intelligence?
Creative process: How does it work?
There is no one answer to this question as the creative process is different for everyone. However, there are some general principles that can be followed to help create valuable and successful products or ideas. 

The creative process begins with the idea or concept. This can be anything from a question that needs to be answered to a plan of how something should be done. From here, it is up to the individual to decide whether they want to pursue the idea or not. If they do, they will need some help in order to turn it into a reality. This includes coming up with a name, designing the prototype, and making sure everything is ready for production. Once all of these steps are complete, it is finally up to the customer or user to test and give feedback before finalizing their decision.
