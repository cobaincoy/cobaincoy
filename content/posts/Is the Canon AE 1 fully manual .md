## Is The Canon Ae-1 Fully Manual? [Solved]
The AE-1 is a shutter priority mode only camera. It does not have a "traditional" manual setting. You can set the aperture and shutter independently but the light meter in the viewfinder will always point to the "proper" aperture the camera thinks it should be shooting at regardless of the current setting.14 Dec 2013
