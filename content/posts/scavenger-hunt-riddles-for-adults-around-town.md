The power of creative: why be creative?
Creativity is one of the most powerful tools we have at our disposal. It allows us to see the world in new ways, to find solutions to problems that might otherwise seem insurmountable, and to connect with others in a deeper way.

- Get out of our comfort zones: Challenging ourselves with new experiences and ideas helps to stimulate creativity.
