## Is There A Difference Between Gin Rummy And Rummy? [Solved]
How it differs from Rummy: The rules of Gin Rummy are similar to those of Rummy. The main difference is that the players do not lay down their sets and runs until they are prepared to end the round. If the opposing player has valid runs or sets in his hand, they will not count as points.25 Jul 2017
