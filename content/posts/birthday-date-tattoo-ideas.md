2020: The United States and China’s new relationship
As the world's two biggest economies start to elbow each other in 2020, it is important to ask what their new relationship will be. What are the key topics of discussion?

How can we come up with big ideas?
One of the great things about being a creativity seeker is that you have all sorts of ways to get your ideas off the ground. You can brainstorm, come up with new concepts, or simply think outside the box. Here are a few tips on how to come up with big ideas:
1) Talk with other people: When you’re brainstorming, it can be helpful to talk with others. This will help you share your thoughts and get feedback. It can also help you create a group consensus on what should be done next.

2) Be open-minded: When it comes tobig ideas, it’s important not to be too tighten-lipped about what you want. If you’re hesitant or afraid of what might happen, it will likely stay bottled up inside and won’t lead to any big Ideas.
