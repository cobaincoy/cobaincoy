How to Use Ideas to Best Effect: What do you need to do in order to create ideas?
If you're looking to create ideas, the first step is to come up with some good ones. There are a number of different ways to go about it, but the most important thing is to be specific and locked down on what you want your ideas to accomplish.

This will helpyou come up with a broad idea of what could work as an idea, but also help you focus on specific possibilities.2) Take everything you've brainstormed and put it into a written list or plan. This will giveyou some idea of where your ideas might fit and what steps need to be taken in order for them to become a reality.

Natural gas: The inventor's story
Invention is a process of creating something new from personal experience, creativity, and the applied sciences. Natural gas is an example of an invention that has impacted the world in a significant way. In 1929, John D. Rockefeller Jr. discovered natural gas reserves in Pennsylvania and began developing them into a field known as The Marcellus Shale. The Marcellus Shale was developed to create energy that could be used to power factories and homes; it was also used to produce plastics and other industrial materials. With the rise of renewables such as solar and wind, gasification of natural resources is becoming an increasingly important technique for powering these systems.
