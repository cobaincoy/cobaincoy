The three Cs of creativity: Concept, Craft, and Color
Creativity is all about coming up with new and creative ways to approach a problem or achieve a goal. It can be found in everything from making art to designing costumes. In order for creativity to thrive, it needs two key components: concept and craft. Concept is the overall idea of what the piece will look like and how it will be used. Craft is the actual creation of the piece, from its conception to its completion. Finally, color is a critical factor in creating an effective work of art. By understanding these three components, creators can better focus on their creativity and produce pieces that are both unique and engaging.

Big ideas are all around us. They're the seeds of new thinking that can help us solve problems or change the way we do things. Sometimes these ideas are small, like a new way to make your morning coffee, or a new way to improve your product. Other times, they're much bigger, like the idea for a startup or a new business model. Whatever form they take, big ideas are always worth exploring and trying out.
