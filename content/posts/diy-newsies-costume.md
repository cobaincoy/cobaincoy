Conclusion: What does all this mean for artists today?
In the past few decades, creativity has become an increasingly popular word in the art world. This is mainly due to the rise of digital technology and its ability to allow for more creative expression.Today, artists have more opportunities than ever to express themselves through their work. However, there are some potential consequences of this newfound freedom that need to be considered.
One potential consequence is that people may no longer view artists as important or valuable members of society. This could lead to a decrease in patronage and investment from businesses and organizations that rely on creativity in their products or services. Additionally, it could prevent young people from learning about and learning from art as a form ofexpression.

Even though these consequences may be minor in comparison to other matters, they should be taken into account when making decisions about how best to support creative art today.
