Creative process: What are the steps?
Creative processes vary depending on the individual, but typically there are three main steps. The first step is to come up with an idea or idea for a project. This can be done through any creative medium such as writing, drawing, painting, etc. Once the idea has been created it is important to test it out and see how it sounds or looks. The second step is to create a rough plan or outline of the project. This will help to better understand what needs to be done and when. The third step is to begin working on the project.

Idea 1: Share your life story
If you've been married for 10 years, or longer, you know that sharing your life story is a tradition. It's a way to show people that you're committed to them and appreciate them. But what if sharing your life story doesn't feel like it's important to you? What if it feels like a chore?
That's where ideas come in. In order to feel more fulfilled in our lives, we need to focus on what truly matters. So why not share your life story with someone who mattersthrough those experiences? Why not tell them everything about your marital status, your job history, and all of the little things that make up your day-to-day?

It'll give them a currency of understanding and appreciation. Plus, they might be inspired by how much you appreciate them themselves... which is always an added bonus!

The difference between left brain and right brain thinking:
Most people use both sides of their brain for thinking, but some people tend to use one side more than the other. Left-brain thinkers are usually more logical and analytical, while right-brain thinkers are usually more creative.
Left-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like math and science, because they can break things down into smaller pieces and see the logic behind them. Right-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like art and music, because they can see the big picture and come up with creative ideas.

Both types of thinking are important, and most people use both sides of their brain for different tasks. But if you want to be good at something that requires creativity, then you’ll need to learn how to use your right brain more.

What is big ideas?
What is big ideas? Big ideas are the seeds of creativity that can change the course of history. They come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one thing in common- they are big enough to generate a response from the average person. Here are some tips on how to get started with big ideas: 
1. Define what you want your idea to achieve. This will help you understand its potential and potential danger. 
2. Look for examples of what has worked before. This will give you a sense for what other people have done that has helped them achieve their goals. 
3. Ask yourself a question: What if? What would it be like if this were to happen? This will help you determine whether or not your idea is really worth pursuing.
