Hi, iam Martin Jones, Buongiorno.
## Should I Write Love On A Card? [Solved]
If you share a very close bond with your card's recipient, you should feel free to express your heart. Closings like, “Love”, “All my love”, “Hugs and Kisses”, and “XOXOXO” are all perfectly appropriate. If statements of love feel a bit too familiar, it's best to close with something friendly but not overstated.
