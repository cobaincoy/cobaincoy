What makes a big idea: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change
When it comes to big ideas, there are three key elements that make them truly great: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change. Without these essential ingredients, an idea is simply not going to have the impact or staying power that it needs to be truly successful.
 Originality is key because it allows an idea to stand out from everything else that’s already out there. If an idea is too similar to something else, it’s not going to make much of a splash. But if it’s completely new and different, people will take notice and want to learn more about it.

Simplicity is also important because it makes an idea easy to understand and remember. If an idea is too complex, people will quickly lose interest and move on to something else.

How to have big ideas
The ability to have big ideas is a skill that can be learned and cultivated. Here are some tips on how to have big ideas:
1. Be open to new ideas and perspectives. Don't be afraid to explore different viewpoints and challenge your own assumptions.

2. Pay attention to your surroundings and the world around you. Look for patterns and connections that you may not have noticed before.

3. Be willing to take risks. Big ideas often come from thinking outside the box and taking risks. So don't be afraid to try something new or different.

4. Be persistent and never give up. Many great ideas come after many failed attempts. So keep trying and never give up on your dreams or goals.

5. Surround yourself with other creative people.

Why do we need to have big ideas?
There are a number of reasons why we need to have big ideas. 
1. Ideas can help solve problems. A big idea can be a solution to a problem that wasn't possible before. 
2. Idea generation can make us smarter. When we have ideas, we can learn from others and become better thinkers. 
3. Idea management is important for startups and businesses. Having a good idea is essential for any startup or business, as having too many ideas will lead to lower productivity and less success. 
4. Idea theft is a problem! Not everyone has the same idea for their business or product and someone else may have an idea that is better than your own and steal your idea without you realizing it. 
5. Idea culture is important for businesses!
