## Should I Buy A Capture Card? [Solved]
A capture card is an essential tool if you're using an external device and recording or streaming on a PC. If, however, you're streaming gameplay directly from a PC, then a capture card isn't necessary. That's because the source stream is coming from the PC itself, so there's no need for conversion or passthrough.10 Sept 2021
