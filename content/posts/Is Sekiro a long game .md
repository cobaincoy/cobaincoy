## Is Sekiro A Long Game? [Solved]
It takes about 30 hours to beat Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, but that doesn't mean the game is completely over. Players who want to finish the game to 100% completion can expect to take an average of about another 40 hours on top of the 30 required to beat the game, for a total of 70 hours in-game.22 Apr 2022
