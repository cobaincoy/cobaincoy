Creativity and art: Definition, difference, examples.
Creativity and art are two very different things. One could say that creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, while art is the creation of art. There are many examples of creativity in everyday life, from making a cake to painting a picture. However, it is interesting to explore what makes creativity so unique.
Different people have different opinions on what constitutes as creative art. Some might call it simply creating something original, while others might refer to it as using your imagination to create something beautiful or powerful. Whether or not you believe in this definition entirely depends on who you ask. What we can do though is provide someamples of creativity that have been influential in our lives.
