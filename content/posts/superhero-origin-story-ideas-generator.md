Underlying drivers of innovation: The need for new information, technology, or business models
Innovation is what makes businesses and societies successful. It allows for new products, services, or ideas to be developed and offered to the public. However, without innovation, businesses can quickly lose their competitive edge and society can become more stagnant. There are several underlying drivers of innovation that must be considered if we want to see continued success for our industries and societies.
New information technology is vital for businesses in order to increase efficiency and innovate faster. Technologies like chatbots and AI have the potential to change how customers interact with businesses, making them more likely to choose a business over another option. By increasing efficiency and reducing customer friction, businesses can sell more products and services at a lower cost.

Technology also plays a vital role in the development of new business models.
