The 4 Types of Ideas: What are the different types of ideas?
Ideas are what make our world go round. They can help us achieve our goals, change the course of history, or even save the lives of others. But what makes an idea unique? What make them different from other ideas?
There are four types of ideas: big ideas, innovative ideas, refreshed and fresh ideas, and breakthrough ideas.

Big Ideas: A big idea is something that is very new and different. It can be a way to solve a problem that people have been trying to figure out for years or it can be a solution to an old problem. A big idea can be anything from a new product to a new way of looking at life.

Innovation Ideas: An innovation idea is an idea that is new and different but still based on older principles or methods. Innovation ideas can range from simple solutions to complex problems.

What is brainstroming and why is it effective?
Brainstroming is a cognitive stimulation technique that has been used for centuries to improve focus, memory, and thought processes. While there are many different ways to use brainstroming, the most common application is called the “six windows of awareness” Technique. This approach provides individuals with six specific windows of focus in which they can engage in focused thought. The windows of awareness can be found at different points in your mind, depending on what you are thinking or studying.
