## Is There A Zero Tailed Beast? [Solved]
Zero Tails (Reibi) was never a Tailed Beast in Naruto in any way. Each of the Tailed Beasts is born out of the chakra of Ten Tails that the Sage of Six Paths, Hagoromo Otsutsuki, separated from his body. With the Creation of All Things Technique, Hagoromo divided the chakra of Ten-Tails into nine different bodies.27 May 2022
