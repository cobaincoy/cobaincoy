The Future of Housing: How will technology change housing and homelessness?
Technology is already changing many aspects of our everyday lives, from how we shop to how we cook. It could soon change the way we live and work too, with implications for housing and homelessness. This article will explore some of the possibilities. 
One idea is that technology could help to create more affordable housing by providing a more accurate representation of what people actually need and want in their homes. Another possibility is that it could help individuals or groups who are homeless or at risk of homelessness to find new homes, either through advertizing or directly working with landlords.
