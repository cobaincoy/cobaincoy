Creativity is a fluid state, and it takes time to get comfortable with new ideas. Sometimes the best way to start thinking of new possibilities is by asking yourself a question. By asking yourself what you could do or how you could be different, you open yourself up to new possibilities. And when you are willing to experiment, creativity can take off in ways you never thought possible.

- Get out of our comfort zones: Challenging ourselves with new experiences and ideas helps to stimulate creativity.

- Be open-minded: Approaching life with curiosity and an open mind allows for greater creativity.

- Take risks: Creativity often requires taking risks and thinking outside the box.

So why not give it a try?
