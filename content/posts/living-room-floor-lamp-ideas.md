The basics: how to brainstorm effectively
Brainstorming is a technique that can be used to generate new ideas for a project or problem. There are a few basic steps to brainstorming effectively:
1. Define the problem or goal. What are you trying to achieve?

2. Gather a group of people together. Brainstorming is usually more effective with more than one person.

3. Generate as many ideas as possible. The goal is to come up with as many potential solutions as possible, no matter how “out there” they may be.

4. Evaluate the ideas and choose the best ones to implement. Once you have a list of potential solutions, it’s time to evaluate them and choose the best ones to move forward with.

Defining creativity
In order to come up with creative ideas, one must first understand what creativity is. Creativity is the ability to come up with new and innovative ideas. It is often associated with art and music, but it can also be found in other areas of life such as problem-solving, business, and even personal relationships.
There are many different ways to define creativity. Some people believe that it is simply the ability to come up with new ideas, while others believe that it is the ability to execute those ideas in a way that is both unique and effective. Still others believe that creativity is a combination of both of these things.

Regardless of how you define it, there are certain things that are necessary for creativity to occur. These include a willingness to take risks, an open mind, and the ability to think outside the box.

Social Media and Digital divide: How will the digital divide affect society?
The digital divide is a problem that many people are beginning to worry about. It's when there is a huge difference in how people use the internet and how it affects society as a whole. For example, if one person is using Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram while another person is using a computer or phone, the first person is likely doing more harm than good. In this way, social media and digital divide have a lot of impact on our society. The future of our democracy may be at stake.

Play: What is play?
Play can mean many different things to different people, and for some, it may be simply taking a break from work or life. To others, play may be something more communal, like exploring new neighborhoods or making new friends. There is no one-size-fits-all definition of what play means to someone, but the important thing is that it is an important part of who we are and what we enjoy.
