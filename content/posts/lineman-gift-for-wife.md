What makes big ideas smart?
When it comes to big ideas, a little bit of thinking and creativity goes a long way. That’s why smarter ideas tend to be ones that are well-executed and scalable. Here are five ways to make your big ideas smarter:
1. Cut out the guesswork: By thinking ahead, you can remove any potential ambiguity or uncertainty. This will help you create a more organized plan and ensure that your idea is well-oiled from the get-go.

2. Carve out a specific target market: You need to identify who your target audience is before you begin working on developing your concept or product. Doing so will help you focus on the right areas of market opportunity and minimize overlap.
