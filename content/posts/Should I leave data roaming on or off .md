## Should I Leave Data Roaming On Or Off? [Solved]
For almost everyone, it's a good idea to leave Cellular Data on. I'm always on the go and I love to be able to access my email, social networks, and internet when I'm out and about. If I didn't have Cellular Data turned on, I wouldn't be able to access any of those unless I was on Wi-Fi.27 Sept 2015
