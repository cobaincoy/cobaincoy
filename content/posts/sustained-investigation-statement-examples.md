Idea for a big goal: What is our biggest goal?
Big goals are powerful tools for getting people to work together and achieve common goals. They can help a team focus on its mission, and create a sense of purpose. 
There are many different ways to create big goals, but here are five tips for creating effective ones: 

1. Start small: Big goals can be created relatively easily if the goal is something that the team is focused on and knows it has a chance of achieving. However, if the goal is something more difficult or time-consuming, it may be more difficult to get everyone together around it. Try starting with something that everyone in the team can understand and achieve. 

2. Break it down: Once the goal has been identified, break it down into smaller tasks that each team member can complete successfully.

7 Tips for the Purpose of Creativity: What are some tips for using creativity effectively in your work?
1. Make a list of ideas. This can be done in any format, but a list of ideas will help you to get started.
2. Think about how you can use the ideas on your list. If you cannot come up with an idea on your own, think about what others have done and what they used to achieve their goals.
3. Draw inspiration from other people and things around you. Studies have shown that imitation is one of the best ways to learn something new. Look at things around you and see how they have helped someone else achieve their goals or reached their dreams.
4: Take action! No matter what creativity may seem like, taking action is always the best way to go towards achieving your goals! Start by thinking of ways that you can improve or take actions that will help your creativity become successful.
