How inventions are created: by coming up with a creative plan or idea and then doing some trial and error
inventive ideas are created by coming up with a creative plan or idea and then doing some trial and error. Sometimes, this process can be a lot easier than you think. If you're not sure how to start your own invention journey, here are five tips to get you started. 1) Think about what you want to create. What are your goals? What do you need to succeed? Once you have these answers, come up with a creative plan that will help achieve them. This will give you a better idea of what kind of ideas work and don't work for your product or service. 2) Be persistent. If it takes longer than expected to get started, don't give up! Keep at it until the project is more successful than when you started. 3) Take your time and make sure everything is in place before starting the experiment.

The Problem/Solution: How do you come up with an idea?
There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how to come up with an idea, but following a few simple steps can help. First, identify what you want to create. This can be anything from a new product to a new way of doing something. Next, think about what others may have done or seen that would inspire you. If you have this kind of inspiration, you can begin working on your idea by imagining what people might be able to do with your product or service. Finally, come up with ways to make your idea even better. By doing this, you will not only increase the chances that your product or service will be successful, but also give yourself the opportunity to improve on any mistakes that may have been made in the early stages of development.
