## What Are 4 Aces Worth In Rummy? [Solved]
Aces are worth 25. Aces played high are worth 15 except in the case where a single player plays a 4-of-a-kind Ace meld, in which case the meld is worth 100 points (25/ea.). Aces can be allowed to "go-around" in order to speed up games; thus allowing a meld of K-A-2. All other cards are worth 5 points.
