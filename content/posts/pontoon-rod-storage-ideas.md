What are the new ideas out there?
There are many new ideas out there, and it can be hard to determine which ones should be introduced into your project. Here are a few tips to help make the decision: 
-Start by asking yourself what you want your project to achieve. If you don’t know yet, consider including goals and target audience in your design.
-Once you have a good idea of what you want, look for potential solutions that could help achieve it. This means identifying problems that need to be solved before anything else can be done, and then thinking of ways to overcome them.
-Finally, consider how much money or time you’ll need to spend on developing the idea before making a decision. If it’s something you think will cost less than both of those things combined, go for it!

Cut down on expenses: How do you save money on your everyday items?
When it comes to spending money, most people tend to do things the same way over and over again. That is, they try to save money by doing everything they can. However, if you want to save money on your everyday items, there are a few ways you can do this. One way is to cut down on your expenses by making small changes in your behavior. For example, rather than spending $5 on a movie ticket every time you go out with friends, spend $3 or $2 instead. Another way of saving money is by shopping at thrift stores or sale areas. There are usually sales going on all the time at these places so you can get good deals on your everyday items.
