Types of creativity: How do different types of creativity differ?
Creativity is a relative term. Some people may say that creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, while others might say that creativity is the process of coming up with new ways to do something.

Design: Design is the process of creating designs that are unique and effective. It can be done through drawings, paintings, or even software programs.

Conclusion: Some final thoughts on creative ideas.
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to make a difference. Whether it’s coming up with a new way to reach your target audience or developing a new marketing strategy, creativity is always key to success. Here are some final thoughts on creative ideas: 
1. Make sure your ideas are relevant to your target audience. If you don’t know what your target audience is, you won’t be able to come up with ideas that will capture their attention.
