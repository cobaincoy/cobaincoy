To create innovation, it’s important to have a clear definition of what you want your product or service to achieve, as well as how you plan on achieving it. Additionally, it’s essential to have a clear vision for the future and how your product or service will help make that vision a reality. Lastly, it’s essential to keep all of these things in mind when developing your product or service – otherwise you may find yourself at risk of becoming stagnant in your industry or at risk of becoming irrelevant.
