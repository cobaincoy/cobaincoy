what is brainstorming?
Brainstorming is a technique that is used to generate new ideas or solutions. It is often used in a group setting, but can also be done alone. Brainstorming involves generating a list of ideas and then evaluating them to see which are the best.
There are a few different techniques that can be used when brainstorming. One is called free association, which is when you come up with ideas without censoring yourself. This can help you to come up with ideas that you wouldn't have thought of otherwise. Another technique is called mind mapping, which is when you create a visual representation of your thoughts. This can help you to see the connections between different ideas and to better organize your thoughts.

Brainstorming can be a helpful way to generate new ideas or solutions to problems.

Cut down on expenses: How do you save money on your everyday items?
When it comes to spending money, most people tend to do things the same way over and over again. That is, they try to save money by doing everything they can. However, if you want to save money on your everyday items, there are a few ways you can do this. One way is to cut down on your expenses by making small changes in your behavior. For example, rather than spending $5 on a movie ticket every time you go out with friends, spend $3 or $2 instead. Another way of saving money is by shopping at thrift stores or sale areas. There are usually sales going on all the time at these places so you can get good deals on your everyday items.
