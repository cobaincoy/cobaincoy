Conclusion: Some final thoughts on creativity
Creativity is one of the most important aspects of life. Whether we are creating new ideas or just coming up with new ways to do things, creativity is essential in any business or creative project. However, while creativity can be a great asset, there are also some risks associated with it. Here are a few final thoughts on creativity: 
1. Some people believe that creativity is only possible when you have a large amount of free time. While this may be true for some people, others find it difficult to come up with new ideas if they are constantly kept busy. So if you want to achieve success as a creative person, try to find ways to relax and allow yourself time for thought and inspiration. 

2. Itâ€™s important to remember that not everyone is born with the same level of creativity.
